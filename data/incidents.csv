Moran for the Western District of Washington.</p><p>Collaborating via an encrypted messaging service, the men identified journalists and other targets — focusing their efforts on Jewish and other minority individuals — and created threatening<a href=""https://dpa730eaqha29.cloudfront.net/myedmondsnews/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Flyer2.jpg""> posters</a> covered in swastikas and containing the line &quot;You have been visited by your local Nazis,&quot; which they then delivered or mailed to their homes, according to the<a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1252261/download""> criminal complaint</a>. One member of the group suggested the men identify their targets using the Society of Professional Journalists&#x27; online freelance directory. Their targets included Jewish journalists and a leader of a black journalists association in the state of Arizona</p><p>&quot;We will be postering journalists [sic] houses and media buildings to send a clear message that we too have leverage over them,&quot; Shea wrote in a chat message. The group coordinated to deliver all the posters on Jan. 25, 2020. Garza wrote that their goal was &quot;a show of force, demonstrating we are capable of mass coordination.&quot;</p><p>A fifth man, John Cameron Denton, 26, of Montgomery, Texas, was arrested and charged separately in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Virginia in a &quot;swatting&quot; conspiracy stretching from November 2018 to April 2019, allegedly targeting a ProPublica investigative journalist and the outlet&#x27;s New York offices, as well as Old Dominion University, a historically black baptist church in Virginia, and a cabinet official of the Trump administration.</p><p>The Justice Department press release defined swatting as &quot;a harassment tactic that involves deceiving dispatchers into believing that a person or persons are in imminent danger of death or bodily harm and causing the dispatchers to send police and emergency services to an unwitting third party’s address.&quot;</p><p>Denton unknowingly met with an undercover FBI agent and described his role in the swatting calls, according to an<a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/press-release/file/1252081/download""> affidavit</a>. He specifically targeted ProPublica and a journalist who worked there because he was furious that he had been identified as the leader of Atomwaffen in a<a href=""https://www.propublica.org/article/atomwaffen-division-inside-white-hate-group""> story</a> for the publication.</p><p>On Dec. 14, 2018, a dozen New York Police Department officers showed up at ProPublica&#x27;s New York City offices after receiving a call from a man claiming to be an Atomwaffen member named James Mason, who claimed he had &quot;multiple pipe bombs, an AR 15, one hostage, and a dead body.&quot; Only one employee was present in the office at time. &quot;This employee was visibly shaken by the threat and police response,&quot; the affidavit said.</p><p>On Feb. 8, 2019, Denton and an unnamed co-conspirator swatted a ProPublica journalist, the affidavit alleges, placing a swatting call to the Richmond Police Department, in Northern California. On the call, the co-conspirator claimed to be the journalist, saying he had shot his wife with an M16 and threatening to shoot any officers who approached his home. Law enforcement officers went to the journalist&#x27;s home, put him and his wife in separate police cars, where the journalist explained &quot;he had been receiving threats because he was a journalist that wrote about white supremacists,&quot; according to the affidavit.</p><p>Following Denton’s February 2020 arrest, Magistrate Judge Nancy K. Johnson ordered him transferred to the Eastern District of Virginia, where he will be detained pending a hearing there.</p><p>Shea is currently detained in Federal Detention Center, SeaTac. He has a court hearing set for March 12, but on March 6 the chief judge for the U.S. District Court’s Western Washington District <a href=""https://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/sites/wawd/files/03-06-20General%20Order01-20.pdf"">postponed</a> all in-person hearings at the federal courthouses in Seattle and Tacoma until at least the end of the month due to the novel coronavirus outbreak. In criminal cases, “the time period of the continuances implemented by this general order will be excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, as the Court specifically finds that the ends of justice served by ordering the continuances outweigh the best interests of the public and any defendant’s right to a speedy trial,” Martinez wrote.</p><p>Garza, Cole, and Parker-Dipeppe will remain in federal custody pending transfer to the Western District of Washington. &quot;There are no conditions of release that would reasonably protect the safety of the community,&quot; read a detention order signed by Magistrate Judge Thomas G. Wilson on March 2, regarding Parker-Dipeppe.</p><p>A spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service declined comment on the timing of this transfer, citing a policy of not discussing prisoner movements.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2020-03-10_at_2.55.03.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A portion of a poster that was mailed or hand delivered to journalists as part of an alleged coordinated harassment campaign from the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,,,

We’re just saying we’re going to treat them as a foreign mission,” the official said.</p><p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang disagreed with that sentiment in his <a href=""http://fm.china-embassy.org/eng/fyrth/t1746893.htm"">daily briefing</a> on Feb. 19. “We deplore and reject the wrong decision of the US,” he said. “The US touts its press freedom. However, it is wantonly restricting and thwarting Chinese media outlets&#x27; normal operation there. This is totally unjustified and unacceptable. We urge the US to discard its ideological prejudice and Cold War zero-sum game mentality, and stop ill-advised measures that undermine bilateral trust and cooperation.”</p><p>Later in that same briefing, Shuang announced that China <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/business/media/china-wall-street-journal.html"">was expelling</a> three Wall Street Journal reporters over anger at a headline in the outlet’s Opinion section.</p><p>In September 2018, the Department of Justice ordered CGTN and Xinhua to register as foreign agents under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA.

The voicemails told Specht to end the investigations into the diocese, threatened to end his career and referenced members of his family.</p><p>“You’re still a bad Catholic and a horrible reporter,” one voicemail warned, according to the complaint filed against the caller. “I hope to God I don’t see you walking around [town].”</p><p>In another, the caller said, “You destroyed the Diocese of Buffalo and Bishop Malone. Oh, you must be so proud. You’re a piece of shit, you really are a piece of shit. You’re not a journalist … and you don’t know how to be a journalist.”</p><p>WKBW reached out to law enforcement when the calls began, the outlet reported, but prosecutors needed more information about the caller and the specific nature of the threats.</p><p>Specht told the Tracker that the calls kept escalating until Feb. 4 when — moments after Specht gave a live report on the diocese’s announcement that the seminary would be closing — the caller threatened to kill him.</p><p>“You must be so happy the seminary’s closing. You’re a bad person. I know where you live,” the caller said. “I’m gonna find you. I’m gonna kill you.”</p><p>WKBW decided to cancel Specht’s 6 p.m. live broadcast as a precaution, he told the Tracker.</p><p>Specht said that he and his family were shocked and scared by the calls. WKBW hired private security for them and had the family stay in a hotel for a week as prosecutors opened an investigation and assigned an FBI field officer to investigate.</p><p>“It was clear that this wasn’t someone who got upset with a news broadcast and did a spur of the moment thing. This was persistent and it seemed like this guy really had it out for me. That’s what really worried us,” Specht said.</p><p>The caller, eventually identified as adjunct seminary professor Paul Lubienecki, was arrested and charged with cyberstalking on Feb. 12, accused of making 11 “harassing” phone calls to Specht between August 2019 and February 2020, according to a complaint filed against Lubienecki. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p><p>Specht told WKBW that he was grateful the FBI made the investigation a priority.</p><p>“Criticism of news reporting is acceptable and even welcomed. But making personal threats against a reporter for simply doing his job goes against the entire American belief in a free press,” he said.</p><p>Bishop Edward Scharfenberger, whom the Pope appointed as interim administrator for the diocese, condemned the threats against Specht in a <a href=""https://twitter.com/BuffaloDiocese/status/1227947700777357312"">series</a> of <a href=""https://twitter.com/BuffaloDiocese/status/1227947703260372993"">tweets</a>.</p><p>“There is no place — nor should there be any tolerance — for threats or harassment towards members of the news media or any one else. This is against who we are as Christians, but also against our nation’s founding principles that guarantee freedom to the press and freedom of speech,” Scharfenberger wrote.</p><p>Lubienecki was released on a $2,500 bond to await trial. The judge in the case <a href=""https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/defense-considers-options-for-man-accused-in-death-threat-of-i-team-reporter"">granted</a> a 60-day adjournment for Lubienecki and his attorney to consider possible defenses, and he is scheduled back in court on April 24.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Specht.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,"<p>A portion of the criminal complaint against a Buffalo, New York, man for allegedly cyberstalking a reporter</p>",None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,,,

Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, vice chair of the Senate Conservation Committee, interrupted the chair to note that Knapp was filming and ask if she had received permission or would like to request it. While committee meetings are streamed through a webcast, Senate rules at the time barred anyone from photographing or recording audio or video without permission from the committee chair. KRQE reported that it never saw the rule enforced, and that a sign posted outside the room to notify the public of the policy noted that the news media was exempt.</p><p>“I figured, it was a public meeting,” Knapp said, identifying herself as a member of the press. A second senator then expressed opposition to her filming, according to KRQE.</p><p>“I just prefer this not to be spliced and edited to be used against someone and have someone not be totally truthful in their comments in a bill because they’re worried how something might be splashed and cut in a newscast,” Sen. Pat Woods said.</p><p>Seconds later, Sedillo Lopez said, “OK, I’m sorry but I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”</p><p>KRQE reported that the sign noting media exemption was removed after its broadcast about the incident.</p><p>Bill Anderson, general manager of KRQE, <a href=""https://www.abqjournal.com/1419708/booting-reporter-from-senate-hearing-was-the-wrong-call.html"">told the Albuquerque Journal</a> that the incident was unacceptable, adding that he assumed it was an “error in judgement.”</p><p>“Nothing good happens in government when these people close the door and want to talk when no one’s listening,” Anderson said.</p><p>Sen. Jeff Steinborn told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that Sedillo Lopez had overstepped the bounds of the policy by asking Knapp to leave.</p><p>“The rule doesn’t allow for that at all,” Steinborn said. “That incident was rightfully embarrassing to the institution: It shined a light on the problem and made it an imperative to fix it.”</p><p>In late January, Steinborn had proposed a resolution to change the rule and allow for both the public and media to record and photograph meetings. The resolution <a href=""https://www.nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?chamber=S&amp;legType=R&amp;legNo=2&amp;year=20"">passed without opposition</a> on Feb. 12, after the incident with Knapp.</p></div></div>

The letter, shared with the Tracker, advised Hixenbaugh and NBC Nightly News producer Janelle Richards that the disclosure of a confidential file is a criminal offense punishable by up to 6 months imprisonment and up to a $1,000 fine, under <a href=""https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/48/XX/981/7"">state law</a>.</p><p>“Please cease and desist immediately from any further illegal use and disclosure of the documents in the child abuse investigation file illegally disclosed to you, and any information obtained in that file,” wrote the agency’s chief legal counsel Therese Durkin. “Failure to comply will lead to further legal action.”</p><p>Hixenbaugh told the Tracker that in all of his reporting on child protective services across the country, never before had a state agency reached out to block his reporting or threaten him.</p><p>“It was unusual and surprising to receive a letter that suggested that I could be imprisoned for doing journalism,” he said.</p><p>NBC attorney Alexander Ziccardi emailed a response to the letter, noting that the agency had falsely assumed the information used in the outlet’s reporting could only have been obtained from a confidential report.</p><p>“[V]irtually all of that information is available from alternative sources that are entirely independent of the CPS investigation file,” he wrote. Ziccardi added that even if NBC did source information from a CPS report it would “unquestionably” be protected under the First Amendment.</p><p>Sarah Matthews, a staff attorney with the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/02/04/gov-tony-evers-administration-threatened-prosecution-journalist/2855362001/"">confirmed to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a> that media outlets cannot be held liable when publishing information that a third-party illegally obtained or disclosed. Matthews is also on the Tracker’s advisory board.</p><p>Hixenbaugh told the Tracker that his reporting ultimately cited only court records and other legally obtained files, such as hospital records and criminal complaints, making no references to a CPS investigative file.</p><p>Thomas McCarthy, communications director for the agency, told the Tracker that the letter was meant not as a threat but as a warning, as the department cannot itself pursue criminal charges.</p><p>“We are concerned with how he received the information, but understand and respect his role as a journalist to report,” McCarthy said.</p><p>Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers spoke in support of the department’s actions after the letter was publicized by media and First Amendment organizations.</p><p>“I believe it’s appropriate that DCF protects the kid in this case. Somebody’s got to stick up for that young kid who was deemed to be abused,” Evers said, <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/02/04/tony-evers-stands-warning-journalist-prosecution-over-reporting/4659301002/"">according to the Journal Sentinel</a>. “Somebody’s got to stand up for the kind, and we did and I did support that.”</p><p>Hixenbaugh emphasized to the Tracker that the privacy of the allegedly abused child was never threatened, as journalistic ethics prevent such disclosures.</p><p>“Although through many different means we are aware of her name and identifying information, we did not name her and would never have named her in this situation,” Hixenbaugh said.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Hixenbaugh_landscape.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,<p>NBC News investigative reporter Mike Hixenbaugh was sent a cease-and-desist letter by the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families.</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,"Janelle Richards, Mike Hixenbaugh",,,,,,,,,

We walked with them until we reached La Fortaleza and by then everyone was chanting and dancing.”</p><p>Velázquez said that he wouldn’t describe the people who attacked him and Ojeda later that evening as demonstrators.</p><p>“I will call them ‘individuals’ because they were certainly not the people we saw before,” Velázquez said. He added that the attackers had hammers and baseball bats, not the pans or cowbells used during the march.</p><p>The reporter tweeted a thank you to those who reached out with their concerns, and said that Ojeda was doing well. Neither journalist responded to the Tracker’s requests for comment.</p></div></div>

Reporters must have the ability to respond quickly to rapid developments and need reasonable access to lawmakers as they deliberate. The proposed restrictions on the use of electronic devices and on the ability of reporters to question lawmakers as they move about the Capitol, as well as the additional security screening, will hinder reporting without an obvious benefit for Senate security.”</p><p>RCFP <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/impeachment-trial-press-access/"">wrote</a> that the U.S. District Court in D.C. found that the Capitol is not a “public forum” under the First Amendment, and therefore lawmakers and Capitol security have some discretion to “reasonably” limit or restrict press access to the building. It wrote that any such restrictions, however, cannot be based on vague or arbitrary standards and must be enforced consistently.</p><p>Tweets from correspondents instead revealed that instructions were often contradictory, and that officers told journalists that they couldn’t clarify or confirm the rules. <a href=""https://twitter.com/Emma_Dumain/status/1217866524217806849?s=20"">Several</a> <a href=""https://www.rollcall.com/news/lack-official-guidance-impeachment-press-restrictions-causes-confusion"">reporters</a> also tweeted that their interviews with willing senators were interrupted by Capitol Police.</p></div></div>

The Indianapolis Star, which republished the Reveal investigation in<a href=""https://www.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2019/11/25/amazon-indiana-governor-eric-holcomb-warehouse-accident-hq-2/4282653002/""> two</a><a href=""https://www.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2019/11/25/amazon-fulfillment-centers-worker-safety-investigation/4283245002/""> parts</a>, also received a cease-and-desist letter from the governor.</p><p>The Reveal<a href=""https://www.revealnews.org/article/behind-the-smiles/""> investigation</a> — which looked at injury records for 23 of Amazon&#x27;s 110 fulfillment centers — alleges that Holcomb personally intervened in the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigation into the death of an Amazon worker who had been crushed by a forklift. Indiana was vying for Amazon&#x27;s HQ2 at the time.</p><p>In his <a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://ipbs.org/projects/assets/Holcomb-cease-desist-letters.pdf"">letter</a> to the Indianapolis Star, Joseph Heerens, general counsel for Gov. Holcomb, claims that the stories contain &quot;serious inaccuracies and falsehoods.&quot;</p><p>&quot;These articles seek to unjustifiably and inexcusably harm the good name and reputation of Governor Holcomb,” Heerens wrote. “But more than that, if these serious inaccuracies and falsehoods are not immediately corrected, they represent a threat to the positive business climate that has been created in our State ... That should not be allowed to happen. You must cease and desist from publishing the articles as currently written and take immediate steps to retract them.&quot;</p><p>In a separate cease-and-desist<a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://ipbs.org/projects/assets/Holcomb-cease-desist-letters.pdf""> letter</a> to Reveal, Heerens goes into further detail about his objections to the story. The news outlets later included a <a href=""https://www.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2019/11/25/amazon-fulfillment-centers-worker-safety-investigation/4283245002/"">clarification</a> and update to one of those objections.</p><p>The Indiana chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists issued a strongly worded<a href=""http://www.indyprospj.org/news/2019/12/3/an-open-letter-to-gov-holcomb-denouncing-the-use-of-cease-and-desist""> open letter</a> to Holcomb condemning his cease-and-desist letters, holding they represent a &quot;threat to press freedom.&quot;</p><p>Signed by the chapter’s board of directors, the open letter stated that Holcomb&#x27;s order is &quot;designed to intimidate reporters and journalists looking into your administration&quot; as well as &quot;add to the overall climate in the nation that looks to undermine the credibility of journalists and media outlets.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Although you might not agree with the contents or conclusions of the report in Reveal and the Indianapolis Star, an unusual call by your office for a cease-and-desist order against the media could chill efforts to report an ongoing story,&quot; the letter said. An email to Russell for additional comment was not returned as of press time.</p><p>The national branch of the Society of Professional Journalists also weighed in with a tweet, calling the cease-and-desist letters an effort to intimidate and silence the outlets:</p></div></div>

It would essentially require, in Alice and Wonderland fashion, a &#x27;libel trial&#x27; prior to the publication of an article. Such a process would eviscerate the First Amendment&#x27;s prohibition of prior restraints on publication.&quot;</p><p>Buchan made these arguments at a hearing before judge Bell on the afternoon of Nov. 14. “You don’t keep the news media in this country from publishing truthful—or what they believe to be truthful—information in this country,” Buchan told the court, <a href=""https://www.wbtv.com/2019/11/14/judge-issues-lifts-restraining-order-preventing-wbtv-investigation-airing/"">according</a> to WBTV.</p><p>Rainey, the attorney for SL Recovery, told the judge that this was not a case of prior restraint. “There hasn’t been a prior restraint at any level,” he said in court. If the restraining order were lifted, Rainey continued, “The court would be tacitly permitting them to make ongoing libelous statements.&quot;</p><p>Buchan countered at the hearing that the law affords injured parties the opportunity to file a lawsuit for defamation, should that occur, but restraining speech by blocking publication would set a dangerous precedent. “That’s not how the First Amendment was designed to work or has ever worked,” Buchan said. “When he says this is not a prior restraint, this is the definition of a prior restraint.”</p><p>Bell granted Buchan’s motion to dissolve the restraining order. “I conclude that the court was in error in granting a temporary restraining order,” Bell said as she announced her ruling.</p><p>“At the time she signed the restraining order, Bell said, she thought the potential significant harm to SL Recovery outweighed the potential harm to WBTV by having to hold its story,” WBTV reported.</p><p>“At that point alone, I stand corrected,” Bell said.</p><p>In a statement emailed to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, Hodges said the experience was a shocking one. “It paralyzed me, but only for a minute before the news team at WBTV went to work defending the first amendment to make sure our story would air on-time,” he wrote. “Time and money are in short supply for any newsroom and are better spent reporting for our community than fighting legal battles already decided by the Supreme Court.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2019-11-20_at_12.45.2.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A portion of the motion to disolve the temporary restraining order placed on WBTV&#x27;s report</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,struck down,David Hodges,,,,,,,,,

The source also claimed to have a copy of the police report from that arrest. In a response to a request for comment, Pishevar confirmed his arrest in a statement to Fast Company.</p><p>Information provided by the source and contained in the alleged police report was used in an article published by Fast Company in November 2017, having received inconclusive responses from the City of London Police concerning the document’s authenticity. The police report was later proven to be fabricated.</p><p>Fast Company <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/fast-company-subpoenaed-identifying-information-confidential-source/"">received a subpoena</a> from lawyers representing Pishevar in August 2019, seeking information they hoped to use in possible future court cases, or “contemplated criminal and civil proceedings in England,” according to a memorandum of law obtained by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p><p>General counsel for the magazine largely complied with the subpoena and follow up emails from Pishevar’s attorneys. They did not, however, provide identifying information about Baram’s confidential source, stating that Baram claimed reporter’s privilege under New York’s shield law.</p><p>Lucas Bento, an attorney for Pishevar, acknowledged that identifying information about the source was the central aim of the subpoena, and threatened to pursue a court-ordered deposition of Baram if Fast Company did not provide the identifying information voluntarily.</p><p>Bento followed through on this threat on Oct. 31, filing an application for discovery for documents, communications and testimony from Baram. The application, which is the process by which subpoenas are issued by foreign parties and approved by U.S. courts, was obtained and reviewed by the Tracker.</p><p>In an affidavit opposing the application filed on Dec. 4, Baram said that he often relies on speaking with sources on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>“My ability to report on matters of public interest depends on my ability to safeguard the identities of my sources and the confidentiality of the information that they provide.

Aviles told CPJ in December that the suit could go to a jury trial in early 2020. The press freedom and legal advocacy group Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/tech-press-freedom-11-3-2019/"">called</a> the case the “first … we’re aware of where the computer crime laws have been misused so brazenly against members of the news media.”</p><p>The City of Fullerton claims that the blog, Friends for Fullerton’s Future, and two of its journalists, Joshua Ferguson and David Curlee, accessed more than a dozen internal documents stored on the file hosting and sharing service Dropbox without permission, according to CPJ’s review. The blog <a href=""https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullerton-police-cut-a-deal-to-bypass-the-law/"">publishes</a> original articles and commentary on the city government and the local police department<i>.</i></p><p>Aviles alleged, in a phone interview with CPJ, that the case is designed to retaliate against her clients for reporting and to block future publication. She told CPJ she has filed an anti-Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation motion, or SLAPP, which permits courts to dismiss lawsuits that are intended to censor public speech.</p><p>“The City’s suit was not in retaliation for anything,” Fullerton’s lawyer Kimberly Hall Barlow wrote in an email to CPJ. The blog was not a factor in the decision to bring the case, she said.</p><p>“If the argument is that a reporter can steal information him or herself and then be allowed to publish it at will, that is neither consistent with the first amendment law nor the ethical tenets of professional journalists,” she said.</p><p>Ferguson routinely requested public records, and the city had provided him with a link to the Dropbox folder in the past, he told CPJ. The city acknowledges sending a link to access the folder in response to records requests, according to court filings reviewed by CPJ. The folder was not password protected, and anyone could access it via the web address in the link. Files that were approved for public release were kept in the same folder as others that had not been, some of which were password protected, according to those documents.</p><p>The complaint said Ferguson and Curlee accessed files in the folder that had not been approved for release, thereby violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a federal law intended to combat hacking, and a similar state law, the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act. CPJ has <a href=""https://cpj.org/blog/2019/06/tech-journalists-troubled-assange-CFAA-charge.php"">reported</a> concerns that the CFAA’s broad wording could be used to punish routine online journalistic activity.</p><p>The complaint said the journalists had intentionally obscured their activity using a virtual private network and the Tor browser — digital security tools that CPJ and others routinely <a href=""https://cpj.org/2019/07/digital-safety-kit-journalists.php"">recommend</a> that journalists use online. The City also requested a forensic analysis of the reporters’ computers and sought prior restraint to block future publication based on the files — a request that RCFP called “concerning” and Aviles called unconstitutional in court documents.</p><p>In November, a trial court in Orange County did not allow that forensic examination, according to Aviles, while an appeals court <a href=""https://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=43&amp;doc_id=2302187&amp;doc_no=G058506&amp;request_token=OCIwLSIkTkg9WzBZSCItUEtIUFw7UFxbJiBeUzpSXDtOCg%3D%3D"">stayed</a> the attempt to block future publication in December. But the anti-hacking lawsuit against the blog is ongoing, Aviles told CPJ.</p><p>“The city is calling me a hacker and a thief,” Ferguson told CPJ in December. Yet, he said, “the idea they are presenting — that hacking is just clicking a link — that idea would literally break the internet if broadly applied.”</p><p>“The conduct that the City complains of is no more criminal than clicking through the City’s website, finding confidential information, and downloading it,” Aviles wrote in court filings reviewed by CPJ. The city’s lawsuit is in “retaliation for Mr. Ferguson’s CPRA lawsuit and to silence the Blog,” she wrote. Immediately before the city launched its lawsuit, Ferguson had filed a California Public Records Act lawsuit requesting the release of documents related to alleged police misconduct, he told CPJ.</p><p>Kimberly Hall Barlow told CPJ that the city decided to file their suit before Ferguson filed his.</p><p>Ferguson told CPJ that the city’s complaint included Christopher Tennyson, his former co-worker at a local camera store where they sometimes shared the same computer, in order to damage Ferguson’s professional relationships. Kimberly Hall Barlow denied this, noting to CPJ that the city later dropped Tennyson from the suit.</p><p>Aviles said the case was draining her clients’ financial resources and impeding their ability to continue reporting.</p><p>“It would be hard for a large newspaper to deal with this,” Aviles told CPJ in November. “But for a blog of concerned citizen journalists — who felt like there was no voice in their community — it’s an outrageous thing to face.”</p><p>RCFP <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/briefs-comments/friends-for-fullertons-future/"">filed</a> an amicus brief in support of the bloggers, as <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/G058506-Fullerton-amicus-brief-of-EFF.pdf"">did</a> the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a leading U.S. digital rights group.

I’m so f------ glad we got Osuna!” directing his comments at three female reporters nearby, one of whom was wearing a purple rubber domestic violence-awareness bracelet.</p><p>Pitcher Roberto Osuna was a Toronto Blue Jay when he was suspended without pay for 75 games during the 2018 season for violating Major League Baseball&#x27;s domestic violence policy. Osuna had been accused of assaulting the mother of his three-year-old child. The Astros hired Osuna near the end of that suspension despite having a &quot;zero tolerance policy&quot; against domestic violence, drawing widespread criticism.</p><p>Sports Illustrated&#x27;s Stephanie Apstein, one of the reporters at whom Taubman directed his remarks, published a<a href=""https://www.si.com/mlb/2019/10/22/houston-astros-roberto-osuna-suspension""> story</a> on Oct. 21 describing Taubman&#x27;s outburst and putting it in broader context.</p><p>&quot;The outburst was offensive and frightening enough that another Houston staffer apologized. The Astros declined to comment. They also declined to make Taubman available for an interview,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Taubman&#x27;s timing was odd,&quot; Apstein continued, as Osuna had not performed well that evening. &quot;He had been, by Baseball Reference’s calculations and any intelligent observer’s assessment, the least valuable Astro that night. So why would Taubman choose that moment, to taunt that demographic? It’s not hard to figure out.&quot;</p><p>But for his arrest for domestic violence, Osuna would likely have never become an Astro, Apstein continued. &quot;Osuna was one of the best closers in the game, and his infraction made him, in the mind of the Astros’ front office, a distressed asset. They traded for him, and in terms of traditional organizational capital, the price was low: the Astros gave up their own struggling closer and two middling pitching prospects for him,&quot; she wrote. &quot;But the price was low for a reason: Many teams didn’t want to deal with the public backlash for acquiring Osuna.&quot;</p><p>The Houston Chronicle reported that Taubman’s comments were directed at one particular female reporter. “In casual conversations at the end of the 2018 season, Taubman complained about the reporter to multiple people,” the Chronicle <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/astros/article/Astros-GM-Jeff-Luhnow-describes-different-14557067.php?utm_source=article&amp;utm_campaign=AOA"">reported</a>, without naming the individual in question.</p><p>After Apstein&#x27;s story was published, the Astros put out a statement accusing the reporter of fabrication: &quot;The story posted by Sports Illustrated is misleading and completely irresponsible,&quot; the<a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EHcvIdRXkAAm7Rx.jpg""> statement</a> began, attributing Taubman&#x27;s comments to &quot;the game situation that had just occurred and nothing else -- they were also not directed toward any specific reporters. We are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated&#x27;s attempts to fabricate a story where one does not exist.&quot;</p><p>Sports Illustrated came to Apstein&#x27;s defense in a<a href=""http://si.com/mlb/2019/10/22/sports-illustrated-statement-response-astros-story""> statement</a> the next day: &quot;Sports Illustrated unequivocally stands behind Apstein, her reporting and the story, which was subsequently corroborated by several other media members present at the scene. Any implication that SI or any of its journalists would ‘fabricate’ a story in its detail or intent is both disappointing and completely inexcusable.&quot;</p><p>Two days later, on Oct. 24, the Astros fired Taubman and tweeted out a mea culpa:</p></div></div>

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Typically, asylum hearings are open to the public and the media except when limited exceptions are invoked, including when &quot;the respondent in an asylum case, which by regulation provides for additional privacy protections, requests that the hearing be closed,” or when such closure is in the “public interest,” according to <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/941991/download"">established Executive Office for Immigration Review policies</a>.</p><p>These exceptions can be invoked on a case-by-case basis, but the access in the tent courts is being restricted to all hearings.</p><p>In a statement emailed to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson—who declined to be identified by name—wrote that because the tent courts are located within U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s “secure port of entry property,” media access to them is limited. “Access to these temporary immigration hearing facilities will operate in accordance with practices for other secure CBP areas,” the statement said. “Requests for access by the media or by the public to the [immigration hearing facilities] will be assessed on a case-by-case basis when operationally feasible and in accordance with procedures for access to any CBP secure facility.”</p><p>Journalists can observe the hearings from San Antonio, Harlingen, and Port Isabel, Texas, where the immigration judges presiding over the hearings are located, the DHS spokesperson continued. The asylum seekers appear in the courtroom via teleconference.</p><p>This arrangement, however, means the journalists will be located at least 150 miles away from the migrants, rendering them unavailable for in-person interviews.</p><p>&quot;Just as it&#x27;s hard for judges to catch emotion and body language from a video hearing, it&#x27;s going to be hard for reporters to accurately describe the scene in a hearing room if we only have access to it via video conference,&quot; Flores said in a statement emailed to the Tracker. &quot;If there are technical issues inside one of the tent hearings we won&#x27;t know what it was like for the asylum-seekers there. We&#x27;ll only be able to see what the hearing was like from the judge&#x27;s courtroom.”</p><p>Journalists need access to these hearings, Flores continued, to cover how the &quot;Remain in Mexico&quot; policy is affecting migrants. “Public hearings are supposed to be public,” Flores wrote.</p><p>Kennji Kizuka, a researcher at Human Rights First, decried the ban on journalists and outside observers in the tent courts in a <a href=""https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/press-release/banning-legal-observers-asylum-hearings-next-step-under-cruel-remain-mexico"">statement</a>. &quot;By banning independent monitors and potential pro bono lawyers from tent courts, the Trump Administration is hiding information about the human rights abuses asylum seekers are suffering after being forced to return to Mexico,” the statement said. “It is just another attempt to cover up the flaws in this sham asylum process, a process created to block refugees from finding safety in the United States.”</p><p>Some 42,000 migrants are now waiting in Mexico for their asylum hearings under the so-called “Remain in Mexico” policy that has been challenged in the courts. On Sept. 11, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-asylum.html"">stayed</a> an injunction in the case, allowing the Trump administration to proceed in enforcing the new policy while court challenges proceed.

The town gained national fame when “Last Chance U,” a Netflix documentary series about junior college football teams, arrived in 2017 to chronicle the transformation of Independence Community College’s football program under new coach Jason Brown.</p><p>The Daily Reporter is a daily newspaper that publishes both online and in print, while the Chronicle is a weekly publication that doesn’t have a website. The Chronicle is edited by Andy Taylor, whose family has been in the newspaper business since the 1870s. Andy’s parents, Rudy and Kathy Taylor, are the paper’s owners and publishers.</p><p>Taylor told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that the trouble began in October 2018, after he published an editorial critical of coach Brown and the ICC football team, which had <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10155860302038716&amp;id=179343538715"">gotten into a physical fight with an opposing team</a> the month before.</p><p>A few weeks after the editorial was published, Taylor received an email from someone claiming to be “Richard Barnwell,” an attorney at The Cochran Firm, a well-known law firm in Los Angeles. The email threatened Taylor with a lawsuit if he continued to write about Brown. (Although Taylor said he could not share copies of the actual emails in advance of the trial, he was able to describe them in general terms.)</p><p>“It looked legit,” Taylor said of the email. “It had the guy’s [photograph] on there. It had a link to the firm’s website. It was just very typical of what you’d see in any cease-and-desist letter. It was typical in the language, where it would start out saying, ‘I represent Jason Brown at Independence Community College, he is my client, any continuing effort to defame or write anything that is negative toward my client will result in immediate litigation against you, please cease and desist.’”</p><p>The email spooked Taylor, who knew that his family’s small-town newspaper could not afford to defend an expensive defamation suit.</p><p>“My parents, who are in their mid-70s, own the newspaper,” Taylor said. “They’re the publishers. So I presented them the cease-and-desist letter, and they were very quick and swift in their decision. In fact, my father said, ‘Andy, you need to cool your jets!’ Meaning, stop being critical of Jason Brown.”</p><p>Fearful of a lawsuit, the Chronicle stopped running editorials and commentary critical of Brown and the ICC football program.</p><p>Then in February 2019, a student at ICC who had been cut from the football team reached out to Taylor with an explosive tip about Brown. The student, who was originally from Germany, told Taylor that Brown had berated him in front of his teammates and mocked his heritage. After the student complained about Brown’s behavior to ICC administrators, the coach sent him a text message: “I’m your new Hitler.” The student shared a copy of the text message with Taylor.</p><p>Soon after Taylor contacted ICC’s president for comment, he received another threatening email from “Richard Barnwell.”</p><p>Taylor said this email referenced the cease-and-desist language of the first email and again threatened a defamation and libel lawsuit if he investigated further.</p><p>This time, Taylor replied to the email. The response he got from “Barnwell” was unprofessional, full of misspelled words — including the word “chronicle” — and personal insults, which made him skeptical that the man on the other end of the email was really a professional attorney. Taylor also noticed that the emails supposedly from “Barnwell” were sent from a Yahoo email address, rather than an email address associated with The Cochran Firm.</p><p>Suspicious that someone was impersonating Barnwell, Taylor called the attorney’s office and explained the situation to his secretary. Barnwell soon left Taylor a voicemail confirming that the attorney had nothing to do with the emails and had never heard of Brown.</p><p>Taylor then contacted the county sheriff’s office and told them the whole story. In May, the sheriff’s office informed Taylor that it had obtained evidence tying the fake “Barnwell” account to Brown’s electronic devices. Taylor also learned that the same email account had targeted another local newspaper — the Daily Reporter — which had run an editorial cartoon mocking Brown.</p><p>On June 28, Brown was charged with four felony counts of blackmail, four felony counts of identity theft, and two misdemeanor counts of criminal false communication, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10156464185298716&amp;id=179343538715"">according to the Chronicle</a>.</p><p>A month later, Netflix released the fourth season of “Last Chance U.” The season details the text message incident and Brown’s subsequent firing but makes no mention the pending criminal charges against him.</p><p>Taylor plans to testify at Brown’s trial, which was originally scheduled to begin in October but has since been postponed to January 2020. Both Taylor and Josh Umholtz, the publisher of the Daily Reporter, and the Daily Reporter itself appear on a list of subpoenaed witnesses. No one from the Daily Reporter has returned request for comment as to whether the organization will comply with the subpoena.</p><p>Most subpoena cases documented on the Tracker involve journalists who are being compelled to testify, often about their reporting and their confidential sources, against their will. This case is different.</p><p>Taylor described his situation as “the flip side of the conventional argument against journalists testifying,” Taylor said, since it involves journalists being the victim of a criminal attempt to intimidate the press. He said he would testify voluntarily even if he had not been subpoenaed in the case.</p><p>“I just want to tell somebody, with my hand on my Bible and under oath, that I did my job, I did it well, and somebody didn’t like that and tried to put my pen away, and that doesn’t work in America,” he said.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2019-10-21_at_12.33.0.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,"<p>The Montgomery County Chronicle is one of two Kansas publications subpoenaed to testify in a criminal case against a community college football coach charged with blackmail, identity theft after allegedly sending false cease-and-desist emails.</p>",None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['PENDING'],None,None,None,None,None,None,"Andy Taylor, Josh Umholtz, The Independence Daily Reporter",The Independence Daily Reporter,,,,,,,,

The public is not allowed to record whatsoever.</p><p>Emily Wetherell, deputy clerk of the Vermont Supreme Court, told VTDigger that the new rules were made to modernize existing policies in the face of technological advances, particularly in regard to smartphones.</p><p>“The registration for media members, too, is a response to the power that cell phones give citizens in the courtroom,” Wetherell said. “That old rule was really just about media, because most people didn’t have the capability or the technology to record. But now most people can … and so in order to identify who media is, the committee decided that a registration process would be the most useful way of doing it.”</p><p>Mike Donoghue, executive director of the Vermont Press Association and vice president of the New England First Amendment Coalition, told VTDigger that while he understands the need to modernize the rules, he has concerns about how the judiciary will determine who is legitimately a member of the media.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://www.manchesterjournal.com/stories/draft-court-rules-would-ban-non-media-video-photos,530892"">The Manchester Journal</a>, when the proposed rules went to the Vermont Supreme Court in January 2018, media was defined as &quot;any individual or organization engaging in news gathering or reporting to the public, including free-lance reporter, newspaper, radio or television station or network, news service, magazine, trade paper, in-house publication, professional journal, or other news reporting or news-gathering agency, and any individual employed by such an organization.&quot;</p><p>Retired state Supreme Court Justice John Dooley, who chaired the procedural rules committee, told the Journal that they worked to adopt a “pretty broad” definition to avoid improperly denying applications for media registration. The registration system also established an appeals process by which a denied applicant can seek an “expeditious review” by the Supreme Court.</p><p>Shawn Cunningham, a reporter for The Chester Telegraph, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that he was reporting on a hearing at the Windsor Criminal Division court when he was pulled aside by one of the court officers. The officer told Cunningham that he couldn’t take pictures without being registered.</p><p>“Now, I had seen this up on the wall the previous time I had been to court, but it seemed as if they were talking about recording, video and audio recording. And they said no, it’s all,” Cunningham said.</p><p>Cunningham said he was directed to the court clerk to register, but because approval would take several days he was able to receive a one-day registration waiver. In a matter of days Cunningham received his media registration, which appears to authorize him to take photos and recordings in Vermont courts in perpetuity.</p><p>“We have several things right now that affect our area that are going through the courts, and that’s both Vermont-run state courts and federal courts,” Cunningham told the Tracker. “So, I’m basically checking all the rules to make sure that whatever I’m going into at this point, that I’m good to go in there and do what I need to do.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/vermont_seal.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>Above the entrance to the Vermont Supreme Court in Montpelier is the state&#x27;s coat of arms.

McCraw provided a copy of the letter to the Tracker.</p><p>“[T]he Naval Station is attempting to exercise a level of control over journalists and their newsgathering activities that has no apparent security justification and interferes with the First Amendment rights of the news media,” McCraw wrote. The existing OMC policy, McCraw wrote, has been effective, “striking a serviceable balance between the need for operational security, the protection of national security and the First Amendment rights of reporters.”</p><p>On Sept. 6 the Department of Defense formally rescinded the new press regulations, after offering unofficial reassurance on Sept. 2 that the rules would not go into effect.</p><p>“It’s a good thing that they’re stepping back and looking at the issue on a more global basis,” said David Schulz, an attorney at Ballard Spahr who has been closely involved in the fight for press access at Guantanamo over the years. “The existing ground rules were the result of extensive discussions with all the relevant stakeholders in 2010.”</p><p>McCraw wrote in an email to the Tracker that he was glad the Department of Defense took seriously the concerns he voiced in his letter. “Guantanamo remains a vital story, and reporters need the freedom to report fully on the proceedings there,” he wrote. “We look forward to working with the Department of Defense to make sure that the rules in place take into account the needs of our news organizations.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/RTX2886S.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,<p>A soldier stands guard overlooking Camp Delta at Guantanamo Bay naval base in 2009.</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,Media,Media,,,,,,,,

They also order the turnover of copies of articles written or generated relating to Effingham County, county Board Chairman Jim Niemann or Lakeside.</p><p>“We wrote several articles about the process which the county used to award the contract to the current emergency service provider: it was done without putting it up for bid and board members have believed conflicts of interest because they have family members working there,” co-founder John Kraft told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. “So, basically they’re asking for all of our sources and the information we gave back-and-forth.”</p><p>Allen, who wrote many of the articles, told the Tracker that the only documents he has that fall under the subpoena are ones he received from Effingham County through public records requests.</p><p>“They know exactly what I got from the county because I FOIA’ed it. So, why did they waste my time with a subpoena for records they already gave me?” Allen said. “It’s their way of trying to create a legal burden on us as well, because there’s no reason for that subpoena.”</p><p>Allen also noted that Edgar County Watchdogs has been pursuing a Freedom of Information Act violation claim against the county for nearly two years, pressing for the release of documents related to the ambulance service investigation.</p><p>The subpoenas ordered the documents produced by Sept. 16, but Kraft told the Tracker that the group’s attorney, government transparency and media lawyer Matt Topic, filed for an extension of 30 days on compliance.</p><p>The federal case was dismissed without prejudice on Sept. 11 by U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Illinois Nancy Rosenstengel, and as a result the subpoenas were dropped.</p><p>Bryan Kibler, the state attorney representing Effingham County, told the Tracker that the case was dismissed pending the results of the state case involving the ambulance service and the county.

David’s brother, Ira Kleiman, is the executor of the estate and claims Wright attempted to steal his brother’s Bitcoin holdings, now worth approximately $10 billion.</p><p>Wright agreed to an interview with Sullivan, giving him a scoop on the case before the courts made an announcement of the judge&#x27;s order. The next day, on Aug. 27, 2019, someone was waiting outside of Sullivan’s home to serve him the subpoena, according to his <a href=""https://modernconsensus.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/i-got-subpoenaed-in-the-craig-wright-ira-kleiman-6-billion-satoshi-nakamoto-case-and-im-not-giving-them-jack/"">article</a> outlining the events.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker reviewed the subpoena, which Sullivan posted with his article.

They are not getting anything from me,” Sullivan wrote.</p><p>Sullivan told the Tracker that he refused to attend the deposition hearing scheduled for Sept. 10. His lawyer filed a motion to quash on Sept. 9, arguing that the breadth of documents requested suggests that the subpoena is a fishing expedition with no clear idea how, if at all, the documents are relevant to the case.</p><p>The filing also included an affidavit from Sullivan authenticating his article and stating that it truly and accurately reflects his interview with Wright. In addition to asking that the subpoena be quashed, they are asking for Kleiman to cover Sullivan’s legal fees.</p><p>“I can fight this for years if I need to,” Sullivan told the Tracker. “What I really want is just to have my press freedom back.”</p><p>On Sept. 20, a judge granted Kleiman’s attorney a 21-day extension to respond to the motion to quash the subpoena against Sullivan.

BuzzFeed provided some of the requested documents while objecting to others on First Amendment and reporter’s privilege grounds. The judge sustained the outlet’s objections.</p><p>Musk was the first to file a subpoena demanding reporter Mac appear at a Sept. 11 deposition in San Francisco. About a week later, Unsworth’s counsel issued its own subpoena against Mac, effectively joining Musk’s.

The topics proposed by Lifrak included BuzzFeed’s guidelines on publishing off-the-record and on-background information, pre-publication review process and editorial process and procedures for predicting article popularity.</p><p>Bolger responded over email, “This request calls for privileged matters related to BuzzFeed’s newsgathering materials and is, indeed, far broader than the request to Mr. Mac. It is not worth exploring.”</p><p>Mac’s attorneys filed a motion to quash both deposition subpoenas on Sept. 13, arguing that any information that could be gained legally is already available to the parties and everything else is protected under California’s reporter’s privilege.</p><p>A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 18.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/MacBuzzFeed4.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A portion of the first of two deposition subpoenas sent to BuzzFeed reporter Ryan Mac as part of a defamation suit between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and caver Vernon Unsworth.</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['QUASHED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,Ryan Mac,,,,,,,,,

According to a memorandum of law filed by Pishevar’s attorneys and obtained by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, Pishevar was released on bail the following day. City of London Police confirmed that July that they would take no further action against him due to insufficient evidence.</p><p>In June 2017, Pishevar, known for his investments in companies like Uber and AirBnB, obtained an injunction in England to prevent UK publication The Sun from publishing his name in any future articles about the incident, according to the memo.</p><p>A confidential source reached out to Fast Company senior news editor Marcus Baram in New York, alleging that they possessed a copy of Pishevar’s arrest report. Baram met with the individual in Washington, D.C., in September 2017 and received a copy of the alleged police report.</p><p>Fast Company published an article containing a statement from Pishevar confirming his arrest, as well as details provided from the source and report in November. The police report was later proven to be fabricated.</p><p>In early August, lawyers representing Pishevar filed an application for discovery by a foreign party to serve Fast Company — through Mansueto, the legal entity controlling the magazine — with a subpoena to produce information. The memo stated the information was for use in “contemplated criminal and civil proceedings in England,” or possible future court cases.</p><p>The application was granted by a federal judge for the Southern District of New York on Aug. 9.</p><p>The subpoena, obtained by the Tracker, asked for all documents and communications relating to the forged police report, particularly any information that could be used to determine the identity of the forger and anyone who helped distribute the report. Fast Company largely complied with the subpoena, with lawyers for both parties exchanging emails in September and October.</p><p>Fast Company did not, however, provide information that would have identified Baram’s confidential source, stating that Baram claimed reporter’s privilege under New York’s shield law. Lucas Bento, an attorney for Pishevar, acknowledged in an email to Fast Company’s general counsel Alison Anthoine that such identifying information was the central aim of the subpoena.</p><p>“While we recognize the source’s name is not being redacted in any of the documents, can you please provide us further information about the individual who distributed the forged police report to Mr. Baram,” Bento wrote, “including his or her name or alias, contact information, Signal contact information (including screen name and number), or other identifying information (such as gender, race, age, height, weight, eye color, hair color, glasses, or dress).”</p><p>Bento also threatened to pursue a court-ordered deposition of Baram if Fast Company did not provide the identifying information voluntarily. In subsequent emails, Anthoine provided information about the individual whom the source said provided them the report, but not about the source.</p><p>Bento followed through on the threat to pursue testimony and documents from Baram, <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/tech-investor-attempts-compel-us-journalist-identify-confidential-source/"">filing an application for additional discovery</a> on Oct. 31, 2019.

When Evers took office, News Director Bill Osmulski and his former colleague Matt Kittle asked to be added to the new list. According to the complaint, they received no response and were never added to the list of approximately 1,000 local, state and national reporters and outlets.</p><p>The complaint also details the barring of MacIver reporters from a press briefing on Feb. 28, 2019, to which 26 members of the Capitol press corps had been invited. Kittle and Osmulski attempted to RSVP and arrived at the designated time, but were not permitted to attend as they were not on the invitee list.</p><p>Suhr told the Tracker that on April 4 he sent a letter to Evers’ office stating that the administration had violated the News Service’s First Amendment Rights and asking for the reasoning behind excluding the outlet.</p><p>A few weeks later, the governor’s legal counsel responded that Evers’ communication’s office “invites some journalists to limited access events, such as exclusive interviews, on a case-by-case basis using neutral criteria, namely newspaper circulation, radio listenership, and TV viewership.”</p><p>The News Service subsequently filed a public records request, Suhr said, seeking any documentation outlining the “neutral criteria” used by Evers’ staff. According to the complaint, Evers’ staff denied the request based on attorney-client privilege.</p><p>The MacIver Institute then filed their lawsuit against Governor Evers in August, alleging he violated its staffers’ constitutional rights to free speech, freedom of the press and equal access. The Institute also motioned for a preliminary injunction from the court that would force Evers’ office to add the News Service to the media advisory list before a ruling is reached in the case.</p><p>In its write-up of the suit, The Associated Press <a href=""https://apnews.com/98c5eb27e33248e78e3f8b62e4eb072a"">reported</a> that governors from both parties have held similar briefings in the past, and that such briefings have typically been open only to certain invited reporters, not the entire press corps.</p><p>The AP also published a statement by Evers’ spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, that Evers believes strongly in a “fair and unbiased press corps” and remains committed to openness and transparency.</p><p>In a brief in opposition to the injunction, Evers’ counsel argued that the existing media list is comprised of journalists and news organizations that “meet criteria which focus on whether the requestor is a bona fide press organization,” and that the MacIver News Service does not.</p><p>A memo dated June 26 from the governor’s Office of Legal Counsel was filed alongside the brief, outlining the criteria used to determine whether a journalist or outlet is “bona fide.” The factors listed are based on the standards used by the <a href=""http://presscredentials.legis.wisconsin.gov/"">Wisconsin Capitol Correspondents Board</a> and the <a href=""https://www.dailypress.senate.gov/?page_id=70"">US Congress</a>, and include in part:</p><ul><li>Is the petitioner employed by or affiliated with an organization whose principal business is news dissemination?</li><li>Is the petitioner a bona fide correspondent of repute in their profession, and do they and their employing organizations exhibit the following characteristics?</li><li>Both avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest;</li><li>Both resist pressures from advertisers, donors, or any other special interests to influence coverage;</li><li>Is the petitioner or its employing organization engaged in any lobbying, paid advocacy, advertising, publicity or promotion work for any individual, political party, corporation or organization?</li></ul><p>The brief asserts that the Governor’s office concluded that the MacIver News Service does not meet these criteria.</p><p>“The MacIver Institute is not principally a news organization. On its website, it characterizes itself as ‘a Wisconsin-based think tank that promotes free markets, individual freedom, personal responsibility and limited government,’” the brief reads. “The organization’s ‘news’ branch makes no effort to distinguish itself from the overall organization mission.”</p><p>In response to these claims, Suhr told the Tracker that the MacIver Institute is a 501(c)3 and therefore legally barred from engaging in political activity, and the Institute is not registered as a political lobbyist. Suhr asserted that news with a perspective has become commonplace in the new media environment, and doesn’t inherently delegitimize the reporting such outlets produce.</p><p>“When government sets up criteria for media, it’s easy to default to this old-school, traditional criteria, to impose requirements like ‘broadcast to a certain number of households,’ or to require that you be a print news outlet,” Shur said, referencing <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/nevada-judges-orders-online-journalist-reveal-sources-says-not-protected-shield-law/"">the case of Sam Toll</a> in Nevada. “To some extent what the governor’s office has done here is they defaulted to criteria that were designed for an old media age, and I think they did that to justify their decision after the fact to exclude my client.”</p><p>According to the complaint, if the governor’s office had adopted the criteria set by the state legislature, MacIver’s journalists would have qualified as they are already credentialed for the Capitol press corps.</p><p>“The new neutral criteria are no salvation: they were not developed openly, are not applied equally, do not permit an opportunity for journalists to show their bona fides, exclude legitimate news outlets besides MacIver, and violate the Constitution,” the complaint states.</p><p>The Governor’s office did not respond to the Tracker’s calls or emailed requests for comment.</p><p>First Amendment experts <a href=""https://apnews.com/98c5eb27e33248e78e3f8b62e4eb072a"">told the AP</a> that MacIver appears to have a strong case, drawing a parallel between MacIver’s exclusion and President Donald Trump’s attempt to bar CNN reporter <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/white-house-suspends-cnn-reporter-jim-acostas-press-credentials-and-falsely-accuses-him-manhandling-intern/"">Jim Acosta</a>.

Kratovil was covering the event on behalf of a reporter who could not, he <a href=""https://twitter.com/Charlie4Change/status/1158360810248384512"">tweeted</a>, and planned to record the gala ceremonies and post the video to the outlet’s YouTube channel without any editing. Kratovil said he was there for the keynote speech, given by White House correspondent and CNN analyst April Ryan.</p><p>Kratovil told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that when he checked in and set up his camera at about 6:45 p.m., the public relations officials did not inform him that there would be any limitations or restrictions on filming the proceedings. Kratovil said that he was able to film the first hour and a half of the event without issue.</p><p>When Rep. Donald Payne took the stage to introduce Ryan at approximately 8:30 p.m., Kratovil <a href=""https://twitter.com/Charlie4Change/status/1158360838580969472"">tweeted</a>, he was approached by a man who said he was “with the speaker,” and asked Kratovil to identify himself. He did so and said he had received approval to cover the event. The man left, Kratovil wrote, but returned and threatened to “take down” his camera if Kratovil did not do so himself.</p><p>Kratovil refused.</p><p>Over the next several minutes, Kratovil debated with the man, later identified as Ryan’s private security guard Joel Morris, and several public relations officials who began to gather around his table, <a href=""https://twitter.com/Charlie4Change/status/1158360843911929856"">according to his account</a>.</p><p>“I maintained a firm position re: video recording, saying I wouldn’t take action until I could get more info on the man who threatened to mess w/ my camera,” Kratovil <a href=""https://twitter.com/Charlie4Change/status/1158360845300244480"">tweeted</a>. “I told them ‘If he doesn’t give me his name &amp; tell me on the record why I can’t [video], I’m not turning off the camera.’”</p><p>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obZ9zZ8IBEg"">Kratovil’s video</a>, security guard Morris can be seen approaching Ryan onstage, who pauses her speaking, appears to look at Kratovil’s camera and nods. Ryan remains silent as Morris then walks towards Kratovil’s camera, grabs it and walks off.</p><p>In the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obZ9zZ8IBEg"">video</a>, which keeps recording, Ryan resumes speaking as Morris grabs the camera and is heard trying to explain the interruption. “When I speak, I don’t have news covering my speech,” Ryan said, adding that she wanted to have an “unfettered conversation with you all.”</p><p>However, New Brunswick-based reporter Chuck O’Donnell from TAPInto, a network of local news websites, was allowed to remain in the room.</p><p>Kratovil told the Tracker that he quickly gathered up his belongings and followed after Morris.</p><p>According to a police report about the incident filed by Kratovil, Morris walked to the front lobby and turned over Kratovil’s camera to the security staff at the hotel’s front desk. The camera was shortly returned to Kratovil.</p><p>Kratovil shared with the Tracker <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Charlie4Change/videos/vb.252573682529/514171555999335/?type=2&amp;theater"">a surveillance recording</a> from the lobby that shows Kratovil holding his camera and moving away from Morris. In the video, Kratovil can be heard saying, “This guy is chasing me.” Morris quickly moves around behind him, and appears to grab and twist Kratovil’s left arm behind his back while pushing him out of the frame.</p><p>The police report noted the injury.</p><p>“According to Kratovil,” Officer Ryan Daughton wrote in the police report, “the privately hired Security Guard utilized some kind of compliance hold and subsequently caused pain to Kratovil’s left wrist. I offered Kratovil medical attention and he refused the same.”</p><p>Kratovil told the Tracker that he ended up seeking care at an urgent care a few days after the incident, where they advised him to treat his shoulder injury as a sprain. He said he plans to press charges.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> <i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Police later determined that it was sent from Banda Treviño’s Facebook account.</p><p>Garcia-Peña said the message was in unclear Spanish, but roughly translated to “You need to shut your trap or this will be you.”</p><p>Brenda Lee, law enforcement liaison for the Starr County Attorney’s Office, <a href=""https://www.krgv.com/videos/arrest-warrant-issued-following-threat-to-valley-reporter/"">confirmed</a> to KRGV Channel 5 News that the message also said in part, “Be informed before moving, you sucker, because soon you will wake up like this. The world is small and I am everywhere.”</p><p>Attached to the message was a picture showing a severed head and a dismembered body, according to KRGV.</p><p>Garcia-Peña told the Tracker that she has received threats before, but this message had more substance and concerned her. She said she reached out to the local district attorney who advised her to contact the special crimes unit.</p><p>Law enforcement liaison Lee told KRGV that local police did not hesitate to take action. “We will not tolerate any news media or any news media outlet being threatened for doing their job,” Lee said.</p><p>Garcia-Peña said that police were able to identify Banda Treviño as the source of the message, but that they believe he left for Mexico sometime in 2018. Police have put out an active warrant for Banda Treviño’s arrest in addition to the indictment he is already facing.</p><p>Garcia-Peña said shortly after KRGV published about the threat she received, Banda Treviño responded with a long, vulgar comment on El Tejano’s Facebook page. Garcia-Peña told the Tracker that this comment did not have threats of violence, but claimed that some of the outlet’s reporting was incorrect.</p><p>The threat has strengthened her relationship with her readers, Garcia-Peña told the Tracker, and she plans to continue working as one of only two reporters covering local crime and politics.</p><p>“I think I’ve gotten more support from my community, more readers,” Garcia-Peña said. “And in terms of me reporting: It hasn’t made me quiet.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Garcia-Pena2.1.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,<p>Texas weekly El Tejano on newsstands</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,Dina Garcia-Peña,,,,,,,,,

Starks, who is white, was <a href=""https://katv.com/news/local/little-rock-police-officer-fired-after-internal-investigation-of-deadly-shooting"">fired</a> from the force in May for fatally shooting Bradley Blackshire, a black man, during a February traffic stop.

Steinbuch told the newspaper that, although the commission performs some quasi-judicial roles, it is not actually a judiciary body.</p><p>“There’s not one, there’s a series of attorney general opinions that say it is well within the citizen&#x27;s right to record and videotape,&quot; Steinbuch told the newspaper. &quot;This is not new. This is well-established. If it&#x27;s not an executive session, if it&#x27;s otherwise an open meeting, a public meeting, then you can record.&quot;</p><p>On the morning of July 25, photographers and videographers were both ejected and barred from entering the hearing room at City Hall where the commission was meeting to consider Starks’ appeal. These included Rich Newman, a cameraman from KATV, Little Rock’s Sinclair-owned affiliate. Officers from the Little Rock Police Department also escorted two bloggers, Russ Racop of <a href=""https://badgovernmentinarkansas.blogspot.com/"">Bad Government In Arkansas</a> and Ean Bordeaux of <a href=""https://corruptionsucks.blogspot.com/"">Corruption Sucks</a>, out of the hearing room after they declined to stop recording, citing their rights under the state Freedom of Information law.</p><p>A reporter for the station, Marine Glisovic, <a href=""https://twitter.com/KATVMarine/status/1154380315751792640"">raised her objection</a> to the ban in the hearing. “As a media member for Channel Seven I’d like to make a statement on the record that this is in violation of the Freedom of Information Act,” Glisovic said. “I’d like to request that no business be conducted until our corporate attorney can challenge this in court.” Despite this objection, no recording was permitted in the room during the morning session.</p></div></div>

It also runs afoul of the Arkansas’ Freedom of Information Act, which guarantees citizens access to public meetings and public records,” the SPJ statement read.</p><p>After consulting with the station’s corporate legal team, KATV hired a local attorney to draft an injunction against the ban. “We let the city know that we planned to file that injunction in the early afternoon if they didn’t rescind that ruling and allow us to be in the hearing,” Nick Genty, KATV’s news director, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p><p>But before KATV filed its injunction, City Attorney Tom Carpenter announced around 3 p.m. that the city had decided to set aside the new rule. &quot;We recommend at this juncture [that] the ban be withdrawn by the commission,&quot; Carpenter said, <a href=""https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jul/26/city-bans-then-oks-recording-20190726/?page=1"">according</a> to the Democrat-Gazette. The previously barred photographers and videographers quickly filed back into the room and began filming.</p><p>In an interview with the Tracker, Carpenter said while the rule was defensible under rules set out for trials by the Arkansas Supreme Court, it did not have the backing of city leadership. “Since the commission is appointed by the city, without the city’s approval it didn’t make sense to have the rule,” he said.</p><p>News Director Genty said he was glad the ban was lifted without KATV having to file the injunction. “We never want to be the story. We just want to cover the story, that’s all we were asking to do,” he said. “They were treating it as a court of law, but this wasn’t; this was a city civil service commission meeting.”</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> <i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Turn around!” Michela responds, “I have a right to be here, sir.” The man, holding his hand over the lens, responds, “Fuck you, no. No!”</p><p>The man approached Michela from the blindspot on his right created by the camera equipment, and was the first of several people to attempt to prevent Michela from filming. Michela told the Tracker that he was jostled enough to cause the camera to zoom erratically and the recording to stop and start multiple times.</p><p>Photos and video taken during the incident show a woman attempting to pull out the cord from the back of Michela’s camera and an arm reaching behind him to pull the camera off his shoulder.</p><p>At one point, Michela said, he felt “the camera being thrown from my shoulder towards the ground. I was able to catch it and prevent it from hitting the ground. It felt like people were pulling at me and at the camera.”</p><p>Larry Curtis, social media manager for KUTV, <a href=""https://kutv.com/news/local/kutv-photographer-assaulted-during-protest-of-inland-port"">wrote in an account</a> published by the outlet, that he “was also at the protest doing a live video on Facebook and rushed into the fray” when he saw Michela surrounded by protesters. In a photo taken by Harmon, Curtis can be seen inserting himself between Michela and some of the protesters.</p><p>Michela told the Tracker, “Larry came over and broke up the fight before it got too involved.” In the process, Curtis wrote in his account, his credentials were pulled off from around his neck and his shirt was ripped.</p><p>The incident left him shaken, Michela told the Tracker. “At the time I certainly felt threatened and I told the officers that I’d press charges if they ever found the guy,” Michela said. “Normally, to most people, my height is a deterrence. I’ve done this job 10 years and I’ve never had someone lay hands on me.”</p><p>During the same incident, Harmon also had to maneuver around protesters who were attempting to block him from documenting the scene, though he told the Tracker that he was not harmed and did not feel threatened.</p><p>According to the Tribune, <a href=""https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/07/11/protesters-involved/"">eight people were ultimately arrested</a> over the course of the protest.</p><p><i>Correction: An earlier version incorrectly identified Larry Curtis&#x27; title.</i></p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> <i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

The order also expanded restrictions of photography and recording to include steps and stairways, patios, hallways and sidewalks, which were not in the original order.</p><p>Supreme Court spokesman Aaron Nash told the AP that the photography ban was intended to reduce disruptions and protect the privacy and security of individuals attending the court, not hinder journalists’ ability to do their jobs. The policy appears to have been issued to unify appellate court policies.</p><p>Brutinel’s order received backlash from reporters and attorneys, the Arizona Republic <a href=""https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2019/11/07/arizona-supreme-court-scales-back-crackdown-photos-video-near-courthouses/4156891002/"">reported</a>, who claimed the broad rule would hamper the media and the public’s access to newsworthy cases.</p><p>National Press Photographers Association lawyer Mickey Osterreicher told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, “It goes far beyond what their authority, I believe, should be.

In an account published by the ACLU of Ohio titled, <a href=""https://www.acluohio.org/archives/blog-posts/photographs-and-the-first-amendment-my-harrowing-journey-through-u-s-customs"">“Photographs and the First Amendment. My Harrowing Journey Through U.S. Customs,”</a> Stegmaier wrote that the officers didn’t provide any explanation for why he was flagged.</p><p>While detained, the officers asked Stegmaier for permission to search his computer.</p><p>“It is possible that I could have avoided five months of psychological stress with three words: GET A WARRANT,” Stegmaier wrote. “But I was sleep-deprived, and innocent of any crime. So I let them.”</p><p>The officers took his phone and camera as well. Stegmaier wrote that he waited 4 ½ hours — causing him to miss his connecting flight to Cincinnati, Ohio — before an officer read him his Miranda rights. The officer proceeded to ask questions about why he was in the U.S., where he was planning on traveling next and whether he had had sex with children while abroad.</p><p>The questions presumably stemmed from photos Stegmaier had taken on his reporting trip. In <a href=""https://www.acluohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-09-03-Stegmaier-Petition-Final-wo-Attachments_Redacted.pdf"">a petition in support of Stegmaier</a> dated Sept. 3, the ACLU of Ohio wrote, “In Manila, he captured numerous images of abject poverty and desperate conditions. He observed and photographed children swimming in filthy water and industrial waste, surrounded by heaps of plastic garbage and fecal matter.”</p><p>The ACLU went on to contextualize the photos: that the presence of unclothed children in public in the Philippines is “unremarkable” and images of such scenes routinely appear in journalistic and other publications.</p><p>When Stegmaier attempted to explain all of this to the CBP officers, he wrote, they were skeptical of his point-and-shoot camera and asserted that he should have “papers” showing that he is a “real” photographer. Stegmaier also wrote that the officers told him that he should consider himself lucky because the supervisory officer believed him enough not to arrest him.</p><p>At the end of his detention, Stegmaier wrote that the officers retained possession of his computer, camera and smartphone, along with the tens of thousands of photographs contained therein.</p><p>“It ruined my trip, as I was forced to halt the planned work that I was going to do in the U.S.,” Stegmaier told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. “I also felt that the seizure damaged my credibility with a couple people that I was in the process of delivering work to. It was debilitating to not have access to my equipment.”</p><p>A month later, Stegmaier received an official Notice of Seizure notifying him that his equipment had been seized because it contained “visual depictions of sexual exploitation of children.”</p><p>In addition to the formal petition on Stegmaier’s behalf, a coalition of First Amendment organizations — including the National Press Photographers Association and National Coalition Against Censorship — wrote <a href=""https://www.acluohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NCAC-Letter-USDHS-August-13-Final.pdf"">a letter to CBP urging the return of his equipment</a>.</p><p>“The possible disregard by DHS of federal and state level constitutional protections granted to Mr. Stegmaier strike at the heart of the most vital rights we strive to defend,” the letter reads. “The seizure of Stegmaier’s laptop, camera, and iPhone has caused untold damage to his professional life, forcing him to halt all of his work activities.”</p><p>Three months after his equipment was seized, Stegmaier wrote that CBP sent him a letter admitting that there was nothing illegal about his photos. The agency promised to return the equipment on the condition that Stegmaier sign a release waiving his right to sue for the wrongful detention and seizure, or else go through a formal hearing process that could take multiple months.</p><p>Stegmaier arranged to pick up his equipment in Detroit, during which CBP stopped him again and asked to search his belongings.</p><p>“Luckily, I carry the ACLU’s petition letter with me, right next to CBP’s letter admitting I did nothing wrong,” Stegmaier wrote. “I showed these letters to them, and eventually they let me go.”</p><p>He wrote that when he left Detroit, he took his equipment and his pictures with him.</p><p>“I don’t have a problem going to other countries to work,” Stegmaier told the Tracker. “I only have a problem returning home to a place where I am supposed to have civilian rights.”</p></div></div>",,None,None,<p></p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,"Detroit, Michigan",True,U.S. citizen,False,False,yes,None,None,yes,yes,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,Tim Stegmaier,,,,,,,,,

Susana Martinez in 2013 over five requests for records related to pardons, emails and the governor’s calendar under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.</p><p>The complaint, which was reviewed by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, alleged that the governor failed to release documents within the mandated time frame and either did not conduct a comprehensive search for or did not provide all responsive documents. The Reporter asked the court for injunctive relief in the form of new policies and procedures for handling IPRA requests.</p><p>The Reporter suit included a separate claim alleging that the administration denied the newspaper access to information provided to other outlets, violating the state constitution’s Free Press Provision.</p><p>“The press must be free to report on public affairs and officials’ conduct without reprisal,” the complaint reads. “A free press and public access to information are undermined if the access of members of the press to facts relating to public business is limited because they present a certain viewpoint or perspective that the Governor does not like.”</p><p>In December 2017, state District Judge Sarah Singleton ruled that, in regards to the denial of access, the governor had not violated the state constitution. Julie Ann Grimm, the Reporter’s editor and publisher, told the Tracker that Singleton’s ruling legitimized politicians giving outlets preferential treatment.</p><p>“The judge in her ruling and in some things that she said in court really made it clear that she felt like it was OK for public officials to pick and choose and to only talk to friendly press,” Grimm said.</p><p>Singleton did find that Martinez violated the state’s open records act three times in its tardy or non-existent responses to public records requests.</p><p>&quot;It is the Court&#x27;s opinion that if people create public documents on private email accounts, then when an IPRA request is made, the governmental body for whom those people are employed has an obligation to search or at least attempt to search those private accounts,” Singleton said, <a href=""https://www.sfreporter.com/news/2017/12/14/judge-gov-martinez-violated-public-records-law-not-constitution/"">according to the Reporter</a>.</p><p>“To hold otherwise would make it too easy to hide from inspection the very types of public records which are most in need of disclosure,&quot; Singleton said.</p><p>The Reporter was awarded attorneys’ fees totaling nearly $400,000 but no damages on the three counts. Grimm told the Tracker that no new IPRA policies or procedures were developed or implemented in response to the outlet’s request for an injunction.</p><p>Martinez’s attorney Paul Kennedy appealed the decision in 2018 on the grounds that the verdict was a split decision, <a href=""https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/state-pays-sf-reporter-legal-fees/article_9198b3b4-3989-11ea-a1ba-438b5bd24f28.html"">according to the Santa Fe New Mexican</a>.</p><p>In a compromise to avoid further litigation after Martinez left office, her successor, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, agreed to drop the appeal and pay a $360,000 settlement in June 2019. The agreement became public in January 2020 after the expiration of the legally-mandated confidentiality period.</p><p>Grimm told the Tracker that she was grateful the Reporter was able to fully litigate the case, in large part because its lawyers represented the newspaper on contingency, or accepting payment only in the case of a favorable result.</p><p>“It requires a great deal of energy to litigate, especially when you’re up against the highest office in the state,” Grimm said. Grimm added that the Reporter is still waiting on records from Martinez’s administration, and access to public records continues to be “an ongoing battle in New Mexico at every level of government.”</p><p>The director of communications for Gov. Lujan Grisham, Tripp Stelnicki, told the Tracker that the governor’s administration has endeavored to communicate with the press without bias and to improve access to public information.</p><p>“We would not have been interested in continuing to defend the previous administration’s obstruction of information to that particular outlet,” Stelnicki said. “That’s not how the governor does things.”</p><p>Stelnicki added that the current administration’s approach is to disclose or provide everything that can be released.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Santa_Fe_Reporter_1.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A portion of the 2013 lawsuit filed on behalf of the Santa Fe Reporter against then-Gov.

Port Authority police officers responding to the protest then arrived and asked him to leave.</p><p>Nigro said that he was wearing two press badges around his neck — one from the National Press Photographers Association and one given to accredited journalists by the NYPD. He showed the badges to the officers and asserted his right to film the protest. After some back-and-forth discussion with the officers, he agreed to leave the area. Unexpectedly, the officers then arrested him for trespassing.</p><p>“While we were leaving, their radio went off and they were told to arrest me,” he said. “They apologized.”</p><p>Nigro was then taken to the Port Authority police station and handcuffed to a wall, and both his phone and camera were seized as evidence. He estimates that he was handcuffed to the wall for about two hours before Port Authority police officers escorted him to an interrogation room, where he was chained to a bench, read his Miranda rights, and questioned by detectives. Nigro said that he refused to answer any questions without his lawyer present. He was then fingerprinted and brought to a holding cell.</p><p>Nigro said that while he was detained in the holding cell, an officer from the NYPD’s media relations office — known as the Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Public Information, or DCPI — visited him in his cell to inform him that the NYPD was revoking his official press badge.</p><p>Nigro was eventually issued a desk appearance ticket and released, but his arresting officer refused to return his camera and phone.

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., then quashed the subpoenas in October.</p><p>A <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/new-yorker-staff-writer-subpoenaed-all-documents-around-2014-article/"">separate subpoena for documents</a> was served to Schmidle in February.</p><p>In 2014, Schmidle wrote a <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/crime-fiction"">feature story for the New Yorker about Tyrone Hood</a>, who had been convicted of murder in 1996 and sentenced to 75 years in prison. Schmidle’s article included evidence strongly suggesting that Hood was innocent.</p><p>In January 2015, outgoing Illinois governor Pat Quinn <a href=""https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/01/13/quinn-commutes-sentence-of-man-convicted-of-lying-in-murder-case/"">commuted the prison sentences</a> of a number of prisoners, including Hood, on his last day in office. Because Hood received a commutation, not a pardon, he was let out of jail early but the murder conviction stayed on his record.</p><p>At the time, a spokeswoman for Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez told CBS 2 Chicago that Alvarez was “deeply disappointed” with the governor’s decision to commute Hood’s sentence.</p><p>Just a month later, though, Alvarez’s office announced that its Conviction Integrity Unit had completed a two-year investigation into Hood’s case, which concluded that Hood’s conviction should be vacated. Alvarez then <a href=""https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-tyrone-hood-conviction-dismissed-met-0210-20150209-story.html"">asked a court to vacate Hood’s conviction</a>, which the court did. Hood was now out of prison and cleared of the murder conviction.</p><p>In 2016, Hood filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city of Chicago and a number of Chicago police officers, accusing them of pressuring witnesses into falsely accusing him of murder.</p><p>On June 18, 2019, the reporter Schmidle was served with <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/1/6/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">a subpoena to testify in the case</a>. The subpoena ordered him to submit to a deposition at a “TBD” location on July 12. About a week later, a process server tried to drop off <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/1/7/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">a new copy of the subpoena</a> (which included the location of the deposition) but Schmidle refused to open his door.</p><p>Attorneys for both Hood and Schmidle have opposed the subpoenas for the reporter, arguing that a journalist’s documents and testimony are not relevant to a case that concerns the alleged behavior of Chicago police officers in the early 1990s.</p><p>Attorneys for the city of Chicago’s attorneys and the other defendants in Hood’s civil rights have argued that Schmidle’s testimony is essential, using a theory that puts Schmidle at the center of the action.</p><p>The defendants’ attorneys have argued that Hood’s civil rights were not violated because he actually is guilty of murder and his murder conviction should not have been vacated. They argue that journalists like Schmidle were tricked into writing a false narrative, which in turn prompted Governor Quinn to commute Hood’s sentence and pressure the state attorney’s office to get Hood’s conviction thrown out.</p><p>On July 23, Schmidle’s attorneys <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/1/1/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">asked a federal judge in Washington, D.C. to quash</a> the two deposition subpoenas, on the grounds that the subpoenas were improperly served, Schmidle’s testimony was unnecessary and Schmidle could not be forced to testify because he was a journalist.</p><p>The defendants’ attorneys defended their decision to subpoena Schmidle’s testimony, <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/7/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">filing a response to Schmidle’s motion to quash</a> that detailed their quasi-conspiratorial theory about Schmidle’s central role in getting Hood’s conviction tossed out.</p><p>“Defendants seek to take Schmidle’s deposition to explore his role in Hood’s coordinated</p><p>media campaign, because that campaign was critical to Hood convincing Gov. Quinn to grant clemency,” the defendants’ attorneys wrote.</p><p>On Oct. 18, Judge Amit Mehta of the District of Columbia District Court <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/12/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">ordered the two deposition subpoenas quashed</a>. Mehta found that, while the subpoenas had been properly served, the defendants had not shown that they had “exhausted every reasonable alternative source of information,” which they must do before forcing a journalist to testify. If the defendants wanted to learn about Schmidle’s communications with his sources, Mehta said, then they should subpoena those sources, rather than Schmidle.</p><p>Through a New Yorker spokeswoman, Schmidle declined to comment.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2019-11-08_at_1.12.59.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,<p>A portion of the subpoena seeking testimony from reporter Nicholas Schmidle about a 2014 article published in The New Yorker</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['QUASHED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,Nicholas Schmidle,,,,,,,,,

LaPorta told the Tracker that he received no response from the Marine Corps.</p><p>When he sent another email on April 22, LaPorta said that he received a response three days later telling him that the general was “flooded with interview requests” and was unavailable, but they would keep his as a standing interview request.</p><p>However, LaPorta saw that <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/06/04/729300525/the-marines-top-general-talks-about-a-changing-corps"">NPR published an exclusive interview</a> with Neller on June 4. LaPorta told the Tracker he reached out to the NPR reporter to ask what he had written in his interview request and when he had filed it: the reporter told him April 24, nearly a month after LaPorta filed his request and one day before he was told Neller had no availability.</p><p>In an email shared with the Tracker, LaPorta asked Col. Riccoh Player, a public relations officer for Neller, why NPR’s request was granted while Newsweek’s was found “unsupportable.” In an emailed response, Player wrote, “Your request has been staffed, discussed, re-looked, risk-assessed and denied.”</p><p>Player’s response specifically mentioned <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/border-funding-general-trump-defense-1382113"">an article</a> published shortly after LaPorta’s interview request was filed, which cited two anonymous Pentagon sources. Player wrote to LaPorta that “this ‘un-named [sic] sources’ technique you incorporated was not helpful in making a case on your behalf.”</p><p>The email additionally cited his “Military ID Card Stunt” at Camp Lejeune, a major Marine Corps base in North Carolina. The “stunt” involved LaPorta using his military ID to access the base in February 2017 in order to speak with a source who said he did not trust the base’s public affairs office. Because LaPorta did not alert the office or receive its approval to conduct an interview, he was indefinitely barred from the base. This denial of access was <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/marine-corps-bans-journalist-camp-lejeune-base/"">documented by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</a>.</p><p>Following Neller’s retirement in July, LaPorta told the Tracker he filed multiple interview requests to speak with the new commandant, but those requests have also been denied or ignored. LaPorta told the Tracker that on July 26 he received an email from Player denying his most recent request because “[The Marine Corps] leaders have a long memory.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/RTX30Z79_v6Yy0ML.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,"<p>Newsweek reporter James LaPorta was denied an interview request with Gen.

The foundation and university had filed a lawsuit and countersuit, respectively, contesting a $100 million donation pledged by the foundation.</p><p>The article was based on documents included in a 66-page stack found in a subway trash can in northern Chicago and brought to the newspaper’s office in the summer of 2017, The Maroon <a href=""https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/8/13/recovered-internal-documents-offer-glimpse-inside/"">reported</a>.

While The Maroon published a summary of some of the documents that August, it did not include documents connected to the Pearsons or the Institute they were funding.</p><p>“The Maroon decided not to publish or mention the Pearson Institute documents, which were marked ‘privileged and confidential attorney-client communication,’ in order to avoid escalating a still-nascent dispute,” Choi <a href=""https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2018/3/5/pearsons-want-100-million-back-from-univeristy-of-chicago/"">wrote in his report</a> the following March.

Choi said the foundation’s subpoena against The Maroon has been left active, however, to satisfy that the foundation is using all avenues of discovery.</p><p>As is the case with Choi, some First Amendment scholars are concerned that Illinois’s shield law may not be applicable to The Maroon as it is a student newspaper.</p><p>The statute <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/privilege-compendium/illinois/#a-shield-law-statute"">defines a news medium</a> in part as, “any newspaper or other periodical issued at regular intervals whether in print or electronic format and having a general circulation.” The Maroon appears to meet this definition.</p><p>Choi told the Tracker that the current editors at The Maroon informed the Pearson Foundation that they cannot provide the requested documents because they are no longer in possession of any copies.

She told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that she pushed back, and asked for a citation of the legal authority that would allow the public to attend a meeting, but not the press.<br/><br/> “[The event] was originally set for those who had signed up as consulting parties to the process, but then members of the public insisted they be allowed in and I went in as well,” Lauer told the Tracker.<br/><br/> Pohakuloa Training Area Public Affairs Officer Mike Donnelly said that the event was not open to the public, and that some consulting parties and signatories to a training programmatic agreement that were present did not want the meeting recorded. However, he said that “to avoid conflict and to show good faith,” the meeting was opened to non-consulting attendees to fill open seats.</p><p>“Notably, only one journalist showed for the meeting in Hilo,” wrote Donnelly. “As a result, we did state that it was not open to the public, however, as a concession and out of respect for the journalist and 20+ years of working with media, I requested the reporter and our subject matter expert to move into a separate room where they could talk and have a Q &amp; A session so the reporter gathered content and context for her story.”<br/><br/>Lauer said that any time she spent with an official focused on gaining access to the meeting rather than on gathering information for reporting.<br/><br/> “If it were an interview for a story, I would have asked them about the details of the project, not about the meeting,” she said.</p><p>Lauer said that she left after being told by both Donnelly and a cultural resource manager for U.S. Army Garrison Pohakuloa that she could not remain.</p><p><a href=""https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2019/05/18/hawaii-news/army-boots-wht-from-public-meeting/"">West Hawaii Today reported that</a> an activist who attended the meeting said that attendance was initially to be limited to a list of consulting parties, but was later opened to the public altogether — before Lauer was told to leave.<br/></p><p>Lauer told the Tracker that on the Monday following the incident the Army commander called her to apologize and claimed he was not aware that his staff had taken the action to ban her from the event. She said that the commander was present at the meeting, near the front of the room.<br/><br/> “In retrospect, the PTA Team could have certainly done things differently, however, we were following the established process and respecting those who are consulting parties and signatories,” wrote Donnelly, the public affairs officer. “We will continue to engage the media in an open and transparent manner.”</p><p>Although Lauer was not able to attend the meeting, she said she was later given video footage by one of the attendees, which she said could aid future reporting.<br/></p><p>On May 19, <a href=""https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2019/05/19/opinion/our-view-military-wrong-to-boot-wht/"">West Hawaii Today published an opinion piece</a> arguing that the Army was wrong to boot its reporter from the event. It expressed concern about how extreme press freedom violations — such as those by President Trump — can seep into the conscious of everyday people.</p><p>“Some of it, like booting the media from a public gathering, we cannot write off as simply silly,” the piece reads. “Kicking a reporter out of a public meeting is a serious issue. It cannot become the norm. The United States military is a first-rate operation. If it says it wanted to err on the side of privacy and caution, we can take that at face value this time around, but still disagree with its decision. The information inside that meeting is meant for the public and WHT will get it and share it, regardless.”<br/><br/>Lauer said this was the first time she had been denied access to an event open to the public.</p><p>“As a reporter with more than 25 years of experience, I am accustomed to various barriers being thrown up as I go about my job informing the public,” she told the Tracker. “This is the first time, however, I have been ousted from a meeting otherwise open to the public. It&#x27;s sad that I, who have worked diligently to portray all sides and prevent bias in my coverage, now have to rely on a video from a source with a known point of view in order to write about government actions that our readers deserve to know about.

Over the course of four hours, the officers aggressively questioned him about his reporting and searched his electronic devices.</p><p>Harp, an Austin-based reporter, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that he has traveled extensively for work, reporting from Mexico and as a war correspondent in the Middle East.</p><p>In an account of the incident <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2019/06/22/cbp-border-searches-journalists/"">he published in The Intercept</a>, Harp wrote that he is usually waved through immigration after a few questions. This time, the questions were more aggressive than usual, and after Harp told the officer that he had spent a week in Mexico on a reporting trip, the officer asked what the piece was about.<br/><br/> “[That] didn’t sit right with me,” Harp wrote. “I tried to skirt the question, but he came back to it, pointedly.”</p><p>Harp recalled saying something to the effect of not having a legal obligation to disclose the content of his reporting. Shortly after, a supervisor told him that if he refused to answer the question he would not be allowed into the United States. Customs and Border Protection officials also repeatedly denied Harp’s requests to contact a lawyer, stating that he wasn’t under arrest.</p><p>When CBP officers returned to ask again about the content of his reporting, Harp wrote that he gave a glib, joking response.</p><p>“From then on out, the officers made it clear that I was in for a long delay,” he wrote.</p><p>Though Harp ultimately told the officers that he was finishing a piece for Rolling Stone about men gunrunning from Texas and Arizona to the Mexican cartel, the officers searched his suitcase and carefully read his journal containing personal and professional notes.</p><p>The officers then asked Harp to unlock his electronic devices so they could be searched as well.</p><p>“When the officers told me they only wanted to check my devices for child pornography, links to terrorism, and so forth, I believed them,” Harp wrote in his account. “I was completely unprepared for the digital ransacking that came next.”</p><p>Harp told the Tracker that while wary of compromising his cell phone and laptop, he decided to unlock them after being denied access to a lawyer in order to prevent officers from confiscating his devices. Over the next three hours, the officers combed through his photos, videos, emails, business correspondence and internet history. They also examined his text messages, including encrypted messages on WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram.</p><p>The officers frequently took his devices out of the room for long periods of time, and Harp told the Tracker that he suspects they may have made copies. They also wrote down his laptop’s serial number and three or four numbers and alphanumeric sequences found deep in his phone’s settings, including the phone’s IMEI number, a 15 digit identity code that can be used to track a phone’s physical location.</p><p>Over the subsequent hours, Harp wrote, the officers questioned him about all aspects of his work, his conversations with editors and colleagues and his political views.</p><p>“Interestingly,” Harp wrote, “they didn’t ask me anything about CBP itself. I had told them my current story was about gunrunning, but they didn’t think to ask if I’d done any reporting on their employer, which I had. In fact, my laptop contained hardwon documents on CBP.”</p><p>Harp told the Tracker that while he can’t be certain the officers didn’t review those documents, he didn’t see them reading the files and they didn’t ask him questions about them.</p><p>On three occasions during the course of his secondary screening, Harp wrote, an officer he identifies as Pomeroy “pronounced words to the effect that he was subjectively forming a reasonable belief that I might grab his service weapon.” Harp wrote that the “rhetorical move” and Pomeroy’s clapping his hand to his sidearm was an “implicit death threat.”</p><p>Four hours after he was pulled into secondary, an officer told him he was free to pack up his luggage and go.</p><p>Harp told the Tracker that the point of writing The Intercept article about his ordeal was to demonstrate the unchecked power that CBP has been accumulating. “CBP has gotten less reigned in and more aggressive, and with few checks on them they can do this to anybody for any reason.”</p><p>Harp wrote that when asked for comment on his article, CBP sent him a statement which read, in part, “CBP has adapted and adjusted our actions to align with current threat information, which is based on intelligence… As the threat landscape changes, so does CBP.”</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> <i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

The code was designed to collect IP addresses and other information from his computer and network.</p><p>Prine has written extensively about the case of Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, who is accused of stabbing and killing a wounded 17-year-old ISIS militant and shooting two unarmed civilians during a 2017 deployment to Iraq.</p><p>The prosecutor, Cmdr. Christopher Czaplak, also sent emails containing the code to 13 members of Gallagher’s defense team.</p><p>Gallagher’s lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the prosecutor for his actions on May 27. “This case has been hopelessly plagued by misconduct by prosecutors,” the filing stated, <a href=""https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/05/28/motion-filed-to-dismiss-lead-prosecutor-and-judge-in-seal-war-crime-trial/"">according</a> to the Navy Times. “This misconduct has taken many forms but has culminated in the inexcusable and unethical use of an email tracking beacon to monitor the emails of opposing counsel in direct contravention of multiple states’ ethics opinions, including CDR Czaplak’s licensing state of New York.”</p><p>In this filing, Gallagher’s defense counsel also argued that the judge in the case, Capt. Aaron Rugh, had met with Czaplak and an NCIS agent to discuss their desire to determine from where leaks in the case were originating.</p><p>At a hearing on that motion, “Navy law enforcement staff detailed how they created a plan to monitor emails sent to Chief Gallagher’s lawyers, while giving the judge in the case the false impression that the Navy had permission to do so from the Justice Department. No warrant or any other sort of permission was issued,” the New York Times <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/us/seal-war-crime-court-martial.html"">reported</a>.</p><p>On June 3, Rugh issued an order removing Czaplak as prosecutor in the case, according to the New York Times. That order is sealed.</p><p>Prine declined to comment further on the case.</p><p>Gabe Rottman, director of the Technology and Press Freedom Project at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said that this was “one of several incidents in recent weeks that raise great concerns about press freedom.”</p><p>“It is certainly very concerning,” Rottman told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. “There have been reports that the tool that was used here could have accessed the contents of emails.”</p><p>If the Justice Department were handling the case, Rottman said, approval from the attorney general would have to be procured before any such tracking code were deployed, and there would also have been a notice requirement to the reporter.</p><p>An NCIS spokesman, when asked about the email to Prine, <a href=""https://www.militarytimes.com/2019/05/17/secret-tracking-device-found-in-navy-email-to-navy-times-amid-leak-investigation-raises-legal-ethical-questions/"">told</a> the Military Times, “during the course of the leak investigation, NCIS used an audit capability that ensures the integrity of protected documents.

He said he allowed them in after being shown a search warrant signed by a state court judge. The SFPD officers then handcuffed him and searched his house with guns drawn.</p><p>Carmody was not formally arrested or charged with any crime, but he was detained for more than five hours. When he was finally released, the SFPD gave him a receipt showing that he had been in police custody from 8:22 a.m. to 1:55 p.m.</p><p>While Carmody was in SFPD custody, two FBI agents asked to interview him, but he refused and requested an attorney. An FBI spokeswoman later told the Times that the FBI agents were not involved in the search of Carmody’s house. Technically speaking, Carmody was only raided by the SFPD, not by federal agents.</p><p>During the raid on Carmody’s house, the SFPD learned that Carmody also used a separate office space for his independent media company, North Bay News, and quickly obtained a search warrant for the office space, <a href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/SF-police-raid-journalist-s-home-in-probe-over-13837363.php"">according to the San Francisco Chronicle</a>.</p><p>In the end, the officers who searched Carmody’s house ended up seizing multiple notebooks, computers, phones, and cameras, while those who searched his office seized a USB thumb drive, multiple CDs, and a copy of a confidential police report into the death of San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi.</p><p>A source had leaked that police report to Carmody shortly after Adachi died unexpectedly on Feb. 22. The police report included salacious details about Adachi’s drug use and possible extramarital affair, and Carmody used the leaked report as the centerpiece of a story about Adachi’s death. Carmody sold his story on Adachi’s death to local TV news stations, who ran <a href=""https://abc7news.com/abc7-obtains-sfpd-report-on-jeff-adachi-death/5153863/"">segments about it</a>.</p><p>Progressive politicians roundly condemned the sensationalist coverage of Adachi’s death and accused the SFPD of deliberately leaking the police report to the media in order to smear Adachi, who had been a frequent critic of the police department. The SFPD also condemned the leak and pledged to track down the source of the police report.</p><p>According to the Chronicle, SFPD Captain William Braconi <a href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-police-get-an-earful-about-leaked-Adachi-from-13779379.php"">testified during a special hearing</a> in April that the police department had launched both an internal administrative probe and a criminal investigation into the leak.</p><p>A few weeks before the May 10 raid, two San Francisco police officers visited Carmody and asked him to identify the source who had leaked him a copy of the police report. Carmody refused. Carmody <a href=""https://californiaglobe.com/fr/journalist-says-police-feds-raid-home-in-pursuit-of-adachi-leak-information/"">told the California Globe</a> that when he refused, the officers warned him that if he did not identify his source, then he could be subject to a federal grand jury subpoena.</p><p>But Carmody never received a subpoena, either from a federal grand jury or a state prosecutor, which he could have contested in court. Instead, a state court judge secretly authorized the SFPD to raid his house and seize his devices.</p><p>David Stevenson, a spokesman for the SFPD, said that the raid on Carmody was part of the SFPD’s criminal investigation.</p><p>“The citizens and leaders of the City of San Francisco have demanded a complete and thorough investigation into this leak, and this action represents a step in the process of investigating a potential case of obstruction of justice along with the illegal distribution of confidential police material,” he told the Times.</p><p>According to the Times, two judges of the San Francisco Superior Court — Gail Dekreon and Victor Hwang — approved the warrants to search Carmody’s house and office, respectively.</p><p>It is not clear who requested the warrants. A spokeswoman for the San Francisco district attorney’s office told the Times that the office was not involved in preparing the warrants.</p><p>Nor is it clear whether Dekreon and Hwang knew that Carmody was a journalist when they authorized the searches of his house and office space</p><p>Thomas Burke, an attorney at Davis Wright &amp; Tremaine who is representing Carmody, said that the raid violated Carmody’s First Amendment rights. He told the Times that the investigators should have issued a subpoena for the records they wanted from Carmody, rather than raiding his newsroom and seizing documents unrelated to the investigation.</p><p>“So much information has nothing to do with the purpose of their investigation,” he said. “If you are looking for one piece of information, that’s why you issue a subpoena.”</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

The indictment lists 36 total documents Hale is alleged to have printed, 11 of which are classified.</p><p>While the reporter to whom Hale is accused of leaking is not named in the indictment, the description and timing of the reporting described in the document suggest it is Jeremy Scahill, who co-founded The Intercept and has reported extensively on U.S. military activities. The Intercept said it does not comment anonymous sources in its <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2019/05/09/statement-on-the-indictment-of-alleged-drone-strike-whistleblower/"">statement on the indictment</a>.</p><p>James Risen, director of First Look Media’s Press Freedom Defense Fund and The Intercept’s senior national security correspondent, also <a href=""https://www.pressfreedomdefensefund.org/news/2019/5/9/statement-on-the-indictment-of-alleged-drone-strike-whistleblower"">released a statement</a>:</p><p>“Like previous prosecutions of alleged journalistic sources, the prosecution of Daniel Everette Hale amounts to an abuse of the Espionage Act to criminalize the process of reporting. Everyone who cares about press freedom should reject the government’s outrageous crackdown on whistleblowers, which accelerated dramatically under President Barack Obama and has escalated further under Donald Trump, targeting the very people who are working the hardest to hold the government accountable for abuses and to protect our democracy.”</p><p>Hale is the <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/leak-case/?categories=7"">seventh person to be investigated</a> by the Trump Justice Department for allegedly sharing confidential information with the press. The Trump administration is on pace to surpass the Obama administration’s record of the most prosecutions of alleged journalistic sources.

Camera!” Ngo said that the antifa protesters were familiar with him and his work, as he has been covering antifa critically since November 2016.</p><p>While standing outside, Ngo said he was approached by a woman from the antifa side who said that she had applied for a job at his mother’s flower shop and a man who recited the shop’s address, which Ngo said felt like a pointed threat.</p><p>Patriot Prayer members arrived at the bar shortly after.</p><p>“[The two groups] were standing at the bar and across the street yelling at each other and eventually it did become physical,” Ngo said. “There was a brawl that involved what looked like pepper spray, mace and bear mace being sprayed, back-and-forth objects being thrown—glasses, bottles—and things were hitting cars and breaking on the ground.”</p><p>About 10 minutes after he arrived, Ngo said he noticed that the interaction was becoming very hostile and decided to move a bit further back.</p><p>“I stood behind a van that was on the street and peaked around the corner with my camera,” Ngo told the Tracker. “And then a masked individual ran from the property of the bar and sprayed the chemical directly in my face.”</p><p>In his video of the incident, a woman wearing sunglasses and a bandana covering her face can be seen coming from the opposite side of the van spraying what appears to be bear spray at members of Patriot Prayer before turning and spraying Ngo directly.</p><p>Ngo told the Tracker that the chemical burned his skin and eyes, and he had to be led across the street by a woman nearby to sit down. “I could still hear the fight and it sounded like it was getting closer and closer to me,” Ngo said. “The people around me said, ‘You’ve got to go, you’ve got to go now.’” Struggling to open his eyes, Ngo said he went to the nearest establishment, a wine bar, to use their restroom to wash what was left of the spray.</p><p>At approximately 8:20 p.m., he called the police non-emergency line to report the incident. Ngo said the operator informed him that all available officers were currently engaged in policing the riot, and that no one would be available to take his statement for several hours. Ngo returned home, and just after 11 p.m. an officer came by to take his statement.</p><p>This was not the only incident Ngo reported to the police that day: He told the Tracker that he was punched while he was covering a protest earlier on that day, which he reported to officers at the scene. Ngo told the Tracker that protesters had recognized him when he arrived at a publicly announced protest just after noon.</p><p>“Immediately, they were hostile to me, although I’ve come to expect that,” Ngo said. “The ones that knew me flipped me off and cursed at me. The ones who didn’t know me went up to me and said, ‘I don’t give you permission to record me.’ I didn’t respond to that: it was in a public park.”</p><p>At approximately 2:20 p.m. a man with his face covered and wearing sunglasses approached Ngo and sprayed his camera with silly string. An Oregonian reporter stepped between them, admonishing the man and prevented him from spraying Ngo or his gear further.</p><p>It was shortly after, as the protesters’ march stopped in front of Portland’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices at around 2:45 p.m., that Ngo says an antifa protester punched him in the stomach.</p><p>In an email, a Portland Police Bureau public information officer said that the investigations into the two assaults reported by Ngo are ongoing and therefore the bureau cannot provide comment or details.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> <i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Independent journalist Justine Barron sued the judge that signed the order and Baltimore’s chief court reporter in response on May 2, alleging that it violates state law protections of public courtroom access.</p><p>Barron has covered <a href=""https://jewishjournal.com/blogs/n_the_case/236270/impossible-story-investigation-shooting-death-baltimore-police-detective-sean-suiter-part-1-commissioner-story/"">numerous stories</a> involving the city’s police department. She sought access to court audio recordings on April 17 as part of a case she is investigating. </p><p>Barron told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that the circuit court was getting ready to fulfill her request, and told her she needed a check or money order. On April 23, Court Technologist Christopher Metcalf sent an email to Barron that she could pick up the record the next day.  <br/></p><p>The next day, Barron was abruptly informed that the court would restrict “access of court audio to parties from now on.” Now, she said, she’ll have to return the money order she obtained to the post office and hope it will be refunded.</p><p>Barron noted that in Maryland, only parties to the case can obtain courtroom video, but anyone can obtain audio or transcripts. </p><p>“I kept being told that I’d have to view it in the office,” she said. “But I was wondering if he [Metcalf] was confused, because I wasn’t looking to view anything. And then it was clarified that they aren’t letting anyone get audio recordings, but didn’t say anything about an order at first.”</p><p>Metcalf’s supervisor, Trish Trikeriotis, wrote to Barron on April 25 that the court had ordered that only parties or counsel representing a party were permitted to receive copies of recordings, although Barron could review the proceedings on site.</p><p>On April 29, Barron was sent a copy of a one-sentence order — dated April 24, the day she had originally been told she would be able to pick up the record — signed by Judge W. Michel Pierson:</p><p>“Pursuant to the terms of Maryland Rule 16-504(h)(1)(C), it is, this day of April 24, 2019, ORDERED, that no copies of audio recordings maintained by the Office of the Court Reporter shall be made available to persons other than parties to the relevant proceeding or counsel to the relevant proceeding.”</p><p>Although courts in Maryland have historically granted the public access to audio recordings, broadcasting these recordings is prohibited. Several podcast producers have <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2019/05/03/baltimore-court-audio-recordings-keith-davis-jr/"">done so anyway</a>, and a local journalist that Barron has worked with in the past has <a href=""https://www.law.georgetown.edu/icap/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2019/04/2019.04.09-Letter-to-Baltimore-City-Circuit-Court.pdf"">challenged the legality</a> of prohibiting broadcasting the recordings. </p><p>A litigator with the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2019/05/03/baltimore-court-audio-recordings-keith-davis-jr/"">told The Intercept</a> that denial of access to these audio recordings was “trying to replace one unlawful policy with another.” </p><p>Barron said that although the order initially appeared to target her specifically, it has affected other Baltimore reporters.</p><p>“After I was denied, at least one other person was able to get his CD,” she said. “The next day, someone was able to get one. So it seemed to be about me at first, but now, they’re punishing everyone.” </p><p>Paul McGrew, a Fox45 investigative reporter in Baltimore, wrote on social media that he was also denied access to courtroom audio recordings under the new order.</p></div></div>

 alleges that Judge Pierson’s order violates Maryland state law, which 
makes audio recordings of all trial court proceedings open to the 
public. </p><p>“...[A]
 local administrative order cannot override a State Rule,” it states. 
“Moreover, the ‘order’ that the Court Reporter’s office cited remains 
shrouded in mystery: the Court has not identified its reasons or 
authority for issuing the ‘order,’ nor has it posted the order publicly.
 These events paint a disturbing picture—that of local court officials 
seeking to stymie the State’s goal of shining a light on the judiciary 
and, worse yet, seeking to do so in the dark.”</p><p>Terri
 Charles, Assistant Public Information Officer for the Government 
Relations and Public Affairs Division of the Maryland Judiciary, 
provided the Tracker with a statement:</p><p>“The
 Judiciary does not comment on pending litigation. The media and the 
public can still listen to the court proceedings at the courthouse. The 
order states that copies are no longer available.”</p><p>Barron
 told the Tracker that courtroom recordings are critical in shedding 
important context on a case so that the press and lawyers can better 
understand what happened — which a transcript of the audio could not 
provide.</p><p>“Transcripts
 are not always accurate,” she said. “They are often full of typos. And a
 transcript is a document that the court has decided we can see — so we 
have to trust that they haven’t made a decision to edit it in some way. 
And the nuance of what happens in courtrooms is very important — like if
 someone stalls before answering or laughs, these details are 
important.” <br/></p><p><i>— The<a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</a> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

The charge was unsealed just hours after Ecuador terminated Assange’s political asylum and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/11/julian-assange-arrested-at-ecuadorian-embassy-wikileaks"">British police arrested Assange</a> inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.</p><p>The indictment — originally filed under seal in the Eastern District of Virginia on March 6, 2018 — focuses on Assange’s communications with Manning in 2010, when she was an Army intelligence analyst looking to leak classified documents to WikiLeaks.</p><p><a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5816961-Assange-Indictment.html"">According to the indictment</a>, between January 2010 and May 2010, Manning downloaded hundreds of thousands of internal government documents — including significant activity reports from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, diplomatic cables, and Guantanamo Bay detainee reports — and leaked them for publication on WikiLeaks.</p><p>The indictment alleges that in March 2010, after Manning had already leaked large caches of documents to Assange, she asked Assange to help her cover her tracks in order to avoid being detected as WikiLeaks’ source. Specifically, she wanted help breaking a hashed password so that she could use a different user account to access the government databases from which she was downloading documents. The indictment alleges that Assange agreed to help Manning decrypt the password, though it does not mention whether he actually did so.</p><p>Assange is being charged with one count of conspiracy to violate provisions of the <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030"">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a>, a broad anti-hacking law that prohibits unauthorized access to computer systems. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison.</p><p>The indictment specifically alleges that Assange entered into a conspiracy with Manning to “facilitate Manning’s acquisition and transmission of classified information related to the national defense of the United States so that WikiLeaks could publicly disseminate the information on its website.” It alleges that Assange tried to further this conspiracy by agreeing to try and crack the password for Manning.</p><p>The indictment also lists different “ways, manners, and means” that Assange and Manning allegedly used to carry out the conspiracy, some of which are typical of interactions between sources and reporters:</p></div></div>

In the wake of this conflict, the principal also changed campus policy so that future issues of the yearbook will be subject to prior review.</p><p>The Seven Lakes High School teacher, Katie Moreno, declined to speak with the U. S. Press Freedom Tracker about the situation, citing the conditions of her employment contract with the Katy Independent School District. But she consulted with the legal team at the Student Press Law Center, and a staff attorney there, Sommer Ingram Dean, provided to the Tracker a 30-page document in which Moreno details her interactions with Seven Lakes principal Kerri Finnesand.</p><p>“When a school district forces an award-winning journalism teacher to resign, you have to think there’s something more to the story than what school officials may be stating. Time and time again we see fearless journalism advisers teaching their students sound, responsible journalism, and winning awards for it, but still struggling to keep a job,” Dean said. “Every adviser that is bullied out of a job and every student that is pressured into silence is a threat to free speech. I hope Seven Lakes understands the gravity of this situation.”</p><p></p><p>Moreno, who has taught at Seven Lakes since January 2014, was awarded the Journalism Education Association’s “Rising Star” award in November 2018, according to an<a href=""http://katytimes.com/education/article_b1f9a6ea-1e4b-11e9-8de0-97d16d333762.html""> article</a> published by the Katy Times in January.</p><p></p><p>According to Moreno’s account, in November 2018 she brought a yearbook page for the Pride Club, the school’s group for LGBTQ students, to Finnesand for her review. The yearbook content had never been subject to prior review before, but Moreno showed it to Finnesand out of respect for a former administrator, whose child was featured on the page. Finnesand wrote in an email to Moreno that the administrator&#x27;s child “will not be featured in the year book with the Pride Club” and ordered her to contact the parent of every student featured “about their child’s quote and the context of the club.” Finnesand did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p></p><p>Moreno drafted a permission slip for parents to sign and let the adviser of the Pride Club know about it. The adviser protested, saying that no other clubs faced such a requirement, so it could be construed as discriminatory. When the adviser brought it up directly with Finnesand, the principal told Moreno she was being “insubordinate” by broaching the topic with the Pride Club adviser.</p><p>On Dec. 5, a yearbook student sent a private message on social media, writing that the principal wanted to change the publication layout for several groups, and have the parents of all Pride Club members sign a permission slip. The student lamented that “[a]ll the work we’ve done to build these clubs, all the memories, all the growth, will all be excluded from the yearbook if we don’t use our voice now in whatever ways possible.” Another student reposted the message, and Moreno brought the message to Finnesand’s attention, who viewed it as a “personal attack,” according to Moreno’s documentation.</p><p></p><p>The next afternoon, Finnesand came into Moreno’s classroom and confronted her within earshot of her students. “She said I’m not doing my job, and that I clearly can’t control my kids. And I ‘let’ them go to social media to slander her. And because of that I don’t need to be the yearbook adviser here,” Moreno wrote.</p><p></p><p>A meeting between Finnesand and Moreno’s journalism students took place on Dec. 7, where they agreed on a plan on how to cover non-curriculum clubs in the yearbook going forward.</p><p></p><p>After the students left that meeting, Finnesand spoke with Moreno again where she expressed that she never has problems dealing with leaders of other organizations. Moreno, in her document, wrote her interactions with Finnesand left her feeling belittled: “[d]ue to the nature of student publications, there will be times she needs to have a conversation with the adviser and with the editors. Every single time I have contacted her with a question or an update, I am met with animosity, condescension, and judgement. This is an unfair comparison, as issues regarding censorship do not arise from service organizations or athletics.”</p><p></p><p>The print edition of the school’s newspaper, The Torch, has always operated under prior review. Moreno’s students dropped off a proof of the December issue for review by Finnesand on Dec. 3, and it was returned to Moreno without any comments. The issue’s cover included an edited image of a girl surrounded by a cloud of smoke, accompanying an article about vaping titled “A Fatal Fad.” The photograph was taken using dry ice. The cover was included in the approved proof binder, but after the issue was distributed, Moreno was given a performance review memorandum to sign for the image appearing on the cover.</p><p></p><p>Following a series of interactions with Finnesand, Moreno sent a grievance letter to Jeff Stocks, assistant superintendent of the Katy ISD, in which she outlined the communication difficulties she was having with Finnesand. At a meeting with Stocks and Finnesand on Jan. 8, 2019, Moreno was giving a document that stated that “campus administration will approve all pages of the SLHS yearbook,” a departure from the previous policy that did not require prior review. At the conclusion of that meeting, Finnesand informed Moreno that she would not be the yearbook or newspaper sponsor next school year, according to Moreno’s account.</p><p>According to Moreno’s account, after a series of meetings with a school district Human Resources representative where the future of Moreno’s teaching contract was called into question, she opted to resign on April 1.</p><p>Moreno will teach through the end of the school year, and in her resignation cited her intention to find a teaching position in another school district, Ingram Dean at the SPLC told the Tracker.</p><p></p><p>Justin Graham, the general counsel for Katy ISD, told the Tracker in an email that Moreno resigned “unilaterally and voluntarily” from her job at Seven Lakes.<br/></p><p><i>Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Jeff Stocks as superintendent of Katy Independent School District.

Ravalo later lodged a complaint with the California State Athletic Commission asserting that the kiss was without her consent and unwelcome. Ravalo also said Pulev sexually harassed her a second time, moments after the interview.</p><p>“I was immediately shocked and embarrassed, and didn’t know how to respond,” Ravalo said while reading from a prepared statement at a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/gloriaallred/videos/10157199305955879/"">press conference</a> following the incident. “Next, I walked to the table to put my items in my backpack.

The newspaper sued after the mayor and borough council sent an official policy letter withdrawing advertising dollars from the Press &amp; Journal in retaliation for the paper’s reporting and editorializing.</p><p>Joseph Sukle, publisher and vice president of the Press &amp; Journal, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that there had been contentions with the borough over the last year or so.</p><p>“I guess they didn’t like what we were reporting or the editorial viewpoints that we expressed, and then they just cut off all communications and not talking to us or our reporters, not commenting,” Sukle said.</p><p>Sukle said he noticed that the borough stopped publishing public notices in the newspaper in June 2018. When he reached out to the borough to see if there was a problem, he was told he would shortly receive an official communication.</p><p>Mayor James Curry III and six out of seven of the Middletown Borough Council members sent Sukle a <a href=""http://cdn4.creativecirclemedia.com/pressandjournal/original/20190326-161915-Ltr_MtownBC_7_17_2018.jpg"">signed policy letter</a> the next month. The letter claimed that the newspaper’s reporting and editorials had been “detrimental to the efforts and initiatives of the Borough” and that it has contained “disheartening and demoralizing instances of distasteful sensationalism, misrepresentation of information and statements, unfounded speculation, questionable sourcing and observable bias.”</p><p>The letter ended: “Should the Press and Journal demonstrate reliability to professionally and responsibly report on the actions and statements of Borough Council and Management, as well [sic] critiquing us from a founded and balanced position, we will be happy to patron your newspaper again.”</p><p>In an <a href=""http://pressandjournal.com/stories/we-are-not-the-enemy-editorial,55807"">editorial following the settlement</a>, the Press &amp; Journal wrote that the letter took no pains to hide the meaning of the advertising ban: “In short, the letter was evidence of an unapologetic retaliation aimed at speech protected by the First Amendment.”</p><p>In an effort to resolve the issue out of court, Aaron Martin, the newspaper’s attorney, appeared at a Sept. 18 borough council meeting to read a <a href=""http://www.pressandjournal.com/stories/press-journal-lawyers-letter-to-council-we-implore-you-to-correct-the-unconstitutional,41133?"">letter</a> requesting a retraction of the policy letter. It argued that the council’s withdrawal of the borough’s advertising after a decades-long business relationship was a First Amendment violation.</p><p>“This attempted punishment of a member of the free press—requiring a kind of probationary penitence prior to restoration—is a naked attempt to coerce favorable press coverage,” the letter <a href=""http://www.pressandjournal.com/stories/press-journal-lawyers-letter-to-council-we-implore-you-to-correct-the-unconstitutional,41133?"">reads</a>.</p><p>The Press &amp; Journal provided copies of the letter to each council member and Mayor Curry.</p><p>“While our attorney was standing there, and just about the time he was finished reading it,” Sukle said, “the mayor actually takes the letter, takes it in his hands, rips it apart, and tosses it on the desk in full view of everybody: fellow councilors, our attorney. It was just an incredible action by an elected official.”</p></div></div>

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>The paper asked that the council respond within seven days to its request in an effort to resolve the dispute out of court. Sukle told the Tracker that, in the end, they waited more than two weeks.</p><p>On Oct. 23, 2018, the law firm of Mette, Evans &amp; Woodside filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the borough on the newspaper’s behalf, asserting violations of the Press &amp; Journal’s rights to free speech and free press under the First Amendment.</p><p>Within days, Council President Angela Lloyd <a href=""https://middletownborough.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018.10.26-Press-Release.pdf"">issued a press release</a> stating, “The global services offered by the Press and Journal do not meet the Borough’s needs.” She also charged that the suit had “no merit in fact or law.”</p><p>On Nov. 14, the borough <a href=""https://dockets.justia.com/docket/pennsylvania/pamdce/1:2018cv02064/118460"">attempted</a> to have the suit dismissed. However, U.S. District Court Judge Christopher Conner ruled against the borough and denied its request for dismissal on Dec. 13, stating that while no formal contract existed between the borough and the Press &amp; Journal, the borough had placed more than 200 notices over the previous 10 years, establishing a reasonable expectation of future business.</p><p>Though government bodies are required to publish certain public notices in publications available to the populations they serve, there are no federally mandated guidelines. In order to not violate the first amendment rights of publications, government entities cannot take into account the content or viewpoint of the news service as a criteria for placing public notices.</p><p>“Judge Conner’s decision will likely provide support to other media outlets facing retaliatory action by government for their reporting and editorializing,” Martin, the newspaper’s attorney, said in the Press &amp; Journal’s editorial.</p><p>Under the terms of the settlement reached in March, the borough is required to spell out its criteria for placing advertisements on bases that are “content-neutral and viewpoint-neutral consistent with the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.” Of the six council members who signed the official letter to the Press &amp; Journal, five remain on the council that established these criteria through a resolution.</p><p>Sukle, however, told the Tracker that the criteria are written in a way that excludes the Press &amp; Journal because it is a weekly publication. Further, Sukle said, the mayor has continued to restrict the newspaper’s access, most significantly to the police department.</p><p>“It’s gone so far that our staff—almost all of our staff—is blocked from the mayor’s Facebook pages, so we can’t access those,” Sukle said.</p><p>The newspaper did not ask for damages in the suit, though the settlement did require that Middletown Borough pay $22,000 to the Press &amp; Journal’s law firm for legal costs.</p><p>In the editorial discussing the settlement, the Press &amp; Journal wrote that it is undeterred by the borough council and mayor’s attempts to sway the newspapers reporting or editorializing: “We are not the borough council’s enemy. And we are not its PR firm.” </p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

The department also took the unusual step of refusing to release a full transcript or a list of attendees.</p><p>The phone briefing was to discuss “international religious freedom” ahead of the secretary’s five-day trip to Beirut, Jerusalem, and Kuwait City. CNN <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/18/politics/state-department-faith-outlets-briefing/index.html"">reported</a> that one member of the department’s press corps was invited, but was un-invited after RSVPing. CNN also attempted to RSVP to the call, but received no reply from the department.</p><p>Despite repeated inquiries and complaints from members of the press corps, The State Department announced that it would not provide a transcript of the call, a list of the faith-based media outlets allowed to participate, the criteria used to determine which outlets would be invited nor answer if the media outlets invited included a range of faiths.</p><p>Religion News Service reported that it was invited to participate in the call, though it stated that the publication “is not a faith-based media organization, but rather a secular news service that covers religion, spirituality and ethics.”</p><p>RNS also included a list of publications that asked questions during the briefing call: the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Algemeiner (which covers Jewish and Israel news), World Magazine (which publicizes its content as “reporting the news from a Christian worldview”), America Magazine (“the Jesuit perspective on news, faith and culture”) and The Leaven, the newspaper of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas. CNN reported that a reporter with EWTN Global Catholic Television said the outlet was not originally invited but asked permission to participate.</p><p>In a statement sent to CNN, a State Department spokesperson said that while some press engagements, including department press briefings, teleconferences, briefings and sprays are open to any interested domestic or international press, that is not always the case. “Other engagements are more targeted or designed for topic, region, or audience-specific media. This has always been the case,” they said.</p><p>Former State Department spokesperson John Kirby, now a global affairs analyst for CNN, told the outlet that he has “certainly seen times when particular journalists or columnists have been targeted for inclusion on given topics.” However, “to exclude beat reporters from something as universally relevant as religious freedom in the Middle East strikes me as not only self-defeating but incredibly small-minded.”</p><p>Kirby also tweeted in response to news that no transcript of the briefing would be released. “This is absolutely not OK. Cabinet officials are public servants. They work for us. When they speak to reporters on the record everything they say—in its entirety—needs to be released at the earliest appropriate time,” he wrote.</p></div></div>

On March 7, after the reporter tried to attend a hearing in the case, the hearing was closed to the public and press.</p><p>Bruce Boyer — a Loyola University law professor whose legal clinic represents the foster children in the case — then requested that the court issue an order prohibiting news outlets from publishing details about the case. On March 14, Patricia Martin, the presiding judge of the juvenile court’s child protection division, granted the request and issued a prior restraint order.</p><p>Documents related to the juvenile court case, including Martin’s prior restraint order, have not been made public. But on March 19, ProPublica Illinois <a href=""https://www.propublica.org/article/cook-county-judge-blocks-propublica-illinois-from-publishing-details-of-child-welfare-case"">reported on the existence of the prior restraint order</a>, describing it as an order “forbidding news organizations from publishing the names, addresses or any demographic information that would identify the children or the foster parents in a case ProPublica Illinois has been investigating.”</p><p>ProPublica Illinois was not initially a party to the case, but it asked the court to intervene in order to oppose the prior restraint order. On March 19, the court granted ProPublica Illinois’ motion to intervene, and on March 22, the news organization filed its opposition to the prior restraint order. A court hearing on the prior restraint order is now scheduled for April 5.</p><p>Prior restraint orders are relatively unusual and should not be confused with sealing orders, which are far more commonly employed by courts. A sealing order is used when a court needs to allow attorneys and parties to a case access to sensitive information; the sealing order just prohibits the attorneys and parties from turning around and disclosing that information to the public. A prior restraint order is much more serious, since it prohibits a third party with no connection to the case (often a news organization) from publishing information that they learned on their own.</p><p>ProPublica Illinois is opposing Martin’s prior restraint order because it sees it as an unconstitutional attempt by the government to interfere in its editorial process.</p><p>“The Supreme Court has made it very clear that courts are not supposed to be editors,” ProPublica President Richard Tofel told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. “One of the Constitution’s guarantees is that editors should be editors.”</p><p>Tofel is correct that legal precedent is on ProPublica Illinois’ side. In 1971, the Supreme Court famously ruled that the government’s attempts to prevent The New York Times and the Washington Post from publishing a classified history of the Vietnam War <a href=""https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/713/"">violated the news organizations’ First Amendment rights</a>.

Toll was sued for defamation in December 2017 by Lance Gilman, a Storey County commissioner and owner of the Mustang Ranch, a legal brothel. In five stories, published between April and December 2017, Toll published claims that Gilman lives outside of Storey County, meaning he fails to meet the residency requirement to hold county office under Nevada law. The defamation suit demands Toll produces the sources of any information he procured before August 2017.</p><p>Nevada&#x27;s shield law—considered to be one of the most robust in the nation—states that &quot;[n]o reporter, former reporter or editorial employee of any newspaper, periodical or press association ... may be required to disclose the source of any information procured or obtained by such person, in any legal proceedings, trial or investigation.&quot; But because this law was passed in 1969, some 14 years before the inception of the internet, it does not explicitly extend this protection to reporters for online publications.</p><p>In what has been criticized as an unduly narrow reading of the law, Judge James Wilson found that &quot;[b]ecause Toll was not a reporter for a newspaper or press association before August of 2017 he was not covered by the news media privilege before August 2017, and therefore, the motion to compel must be granted as to any source of information obtained or procured by Toll before August of 2017.&quot;</p><p>Wilson ruled that because the Storey Teller is an online-only publication, it &quot;is not a newspaper and, therefore the news media privilege is not available to Toll under the &#x27;reporter of a newspaper&#x27; provision of [Nevada&#x27;s shield law].&quot;</p><p>In at least two other instances, Nevada courts have ruled that web-only publications were covered by the shield law, <a href=""https://www.rgj.com/story/news/nation/2019/03/07/nevada-judge-rules-online-sites-not-protected-media-shield-law/3098026002/"">according</a> to the Reno Gazette Journal. “My understanding is that it’s the first ruling of its kind and actually conflicts with other rulings,” Richard Karpel, executive director of the Nevada Press Association, told the newspaper.</p><p>Toll&#x27;s lawyers filed a petition for writ of prohibition with the state Supreme Court on March 18. &quot;While we respect Judge Wilson, we fundamentally disagree that an online journalist should be compelled to reveal their sources because they publish news articles in an online newspaper instead of traditional print newspaper,&quot; Luke Busby, one of Toll&#x27;s attorneys, wrote in a statement. &quot;Such a ruling undermines the protection of fundamental Constitutional principles of freedom of speech and of the press and stifles the free flow of information that is essential for any free society to exist.&quot;</p><p>On March 22, the Supreme Court stayed Gilman’s discovery request, pending review of Toll’s writ of prohibition. A deposition had been scheduled for March 25.<br/></p><p>Other critics opined that Judge Wilson was splitting hairs in his order. &quot;Unlike too many jobs in this country there is no such thing as a licensed journalist,&quot; newspaper columnist Thomas Mitchell <a href=""https://elkodaily.com/opinion/columnists/thomas-mitchell-nevada-press-shield-law-protects-bloggers/article_431a34d6-e23f-5499-b2cf-30cfcc19edea.html"">wrote</a> in the Elko Daily Free Press.</p><p>Toll told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that he would go to jail, if necessary, to protect his sources. But he worried that if this ruling stands, it could have a chilling effect on online media in Nevada.</p><p>&quot;It would be potentially devastating for people who report on matters of public interest to not be able to protect whistleblowers,&quot; Toll said. &quot;Do I relish going to jail? No. But for the people behind me, who currently have an online-only presence, I owe it to them to stand my ground.&quot;</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

After boisterous protests, including from pool photojournalists, Sanders conceded that one print reporter would be permitted to attend: Vivian Salama of The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The four pool reporters who were barred: Jonathan Lemire of The Associated Press, Jeff Mason of Reuters, Justin Sink of Bloomberg News, and Eli Stokols of the Los Angeles Times.</p><p>The Washington Post reported that when Sanders was asked why the journalists representing the three largest wire services and a major newspaper were excluded, she said that it was because of “sensitivities over shouted questions in the previous sprays.”</p><p>During two brief photo opportunities on Wednesday night, American reporters—including Lemire and Mason—directed four questions at Trump; They asked Kim none. Trump and his aides have often complained about reporters asking the president questions during photo opportunities, particularly in the presence of foreign leaders.</p><p>In November, the White House <a href=""https://twitter.com/jamiedupree/status/1064632625598529537/photo/1"">issued</a> new press conduct guidelines and has occasionally punished reporters for their questioning, most notably CNN reporters <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/white-house-suspends-cnn-reporter-jim-acostas-press-credentials-and-falsely-accuses-him-manhandling-intern/"">Jim Acosta</a> and <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/white-house-bans-cnn-reporter-event-asking-inappropriate-questions/"">Kaitlan Collins</a>, the latter of whom was banned from attending an event in retaliation for trying to ask President Trump a question during a photo-op.</p><p>Traditionally the White House has upheld the rights of journalists while a president is traveling overseas, particularly in instances where the president is meeting with leaders of a country where press freedom is limited or absent.</p><p>LA Times Executive Editor Norman Pearlstine said in a <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-trump-kim-vietnam-summit-20190227-story.html"">statement</a>, “Previous administrations have often intervened to protect press access when foreign leaders have tried to limit coverage of presidential meetings abroad. The fact that this White House has done the opposite and excluded members of the press provides another sad example of its failure to uphold the American public’s right to see and be informed about President Trump’s activities.”</p><p>In a <a href=""https://twitter.com/whca/status/1100804535587692544"">statement</a>, Olivier Knox, White House Correspondents’ Association president, called the decision to exclude some of the journalists “capricious.” “This summit provides an opportunity for the American presidency to display its strength by facing vigorous questioning from a free and independent news media, not telegraph weakness by retreating behind arbitrary last-minute restrictions on coverage.”</p><p>Members of the press pool repeatedly asked Sanders whether North Korea was responsible for the restricted access, but she would not provide a direct answer. The ban came a day after the press pool was booted from the hotel where the White House had booked conference facilities to be used as a press workspace because Kim’s delegation had decided to stay at the same hotel.</p><p>In an emailed statement, Sanders said, “We are continuing to negotiate aspects of this historic summit and will always work to make sure the U.S. media has as much access as possible.”</p><p>The summit ended prematurely on Feb. 28.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

In an account of the incident, Elk <a href=""http://paydayreport.com/pa-police-threatened-me-with-arrest-for-recording-search-of-a-black-man/"">wrote</a> for the labor publication that he was heading toward the exit when he noticed three undercover state police officers corner and begin searching a black man. He said he followed his journalistic instinct and began to record the interaction.</p><p>After the officers finished searching the man’s bags and released him, Elk told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that an officer saw that he was recording and approached him, demanding to see his identification while the two other undercover officers “hovered” nearby. Elk identified himself as a journalist and told the officer that he felt within his rights to record them in a public space.</p><p>“The undercover cop told me that I was illegally wiretapping him,” Elk wrote in his account. The officer noted that Elk’s breath smelled of alcohol—Elk wrote that he had three Bud Lites on the train—and that he could be arrested for public intoxication as soon as he stopped outside the station.</p><p>When the officer repeated his demand that Elk show him identification, Elk handed the officer his passport, which Elk said was in his back pocket as he had just returned from Portugal. Elk wrote that the officer mocked him as “fancy” for having a passport, demanded to see his driver’s license and repeated his threat to arrest Elk once he left the train station.</p><p>“I showed [my driver’s license] to him and he said we are gonna check to see if they [sic] are any warrants out for your arrest,” Elk recounted.</p><p>Elk volunteered to erase the video he had taken of the officers’ interaction with the black man. “I informed the officer that I would erase the recording. Three cops crowded around me and watched as I deleted it,” Elk wrote. However, he continued, “the threats continued even after I erased the recording.</p><p>Elk wrote that after a few minutes he and the officer threatening arrest came to an agreement to walk away. A different officer approached him then and told Elk, “Why do you fuck with us? Don’t fuck with us and we won’t fuck with you.”</p><p>Elk said he was able to leave the station approximately five minutes after he had disembarked from the train. Elk wrote that he has reached out to the American Civil Liberties Union and plans to take legal action in order to assert the rights of journalists, and the public generally, to record incidents involving the police in public spaces.</p><p>“This is my hometown and I am not gonna be intimidated for standing up for racial justice,” Elk wrote.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Schmidle’s article included evidence strongly suggesting that Hood was innocent.</p><p>In January 2015, outgoing Illinois governor Pat Quinn <a href=""https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/01/13/quinn-commutes-sentence-of-man-convicted-of-lying-in-murder-case/"">commuted the prison sentences</a> of a number of prisoners, including Hood, on his last day in office. Because Hood received a commutation, not a pardon, he was let out of jail early but the murder conviction stayed on his record.</p><p>At the time, a spokeswoman for Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez told CBS 2 Chicago that Alvarez was “deeply disappointed” with the governor’s decision to commute Hood’s sentence.</p><p>Just a month later, though, Alvarez’s office announced that its Conviction Integrity Unit had completed a two-year investigation into Hood’s case, which concluded that Hood’s conviction should be vacated. Alvarez then <a href=""https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-tyrone-hood-conviction-dismissed-met-0210-20150209-story.html"">asked a court to vacate Hood’s conviction</a>, which the court did. Hood was now out of prison and cleared of the murder conviction.</p><p>In 2016, Hood filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city of Chicago and a number of Chicago police officers, accusing them of pressuring witnesses into falsely accusing him of murder.</p><p>On Feb. 22, 2019, the defendants’ attorneys mailed the reporter Schmidle a document subpoena. The <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/1/4/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">extremely broad subpoena</a> ordered him to turn over, among other things, “All Documents Nicholas Schmidle received from any person or entity in connection with researching, investigating, preparing or publishing any of the Articles” about Hood. Schmidle’s attorneys <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/1/5/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">objected to the subpoena</a> on March 13, and the defendants seemed to drop it.</p><p>In June 2019, Schmidle was served with <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/1/6/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">a subpoena to testify in the case</a> and a <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/1/7/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">second, more complete copy</a> of the same subpoena a week later.</p><p>Attorneys for both Hood and Schmidle have opposed the subpoenas for the reporter, arguing that a journalist’s documents and testimony are not relevant to a case that concerns the alleged behavior of Chicago police officers in the early 1990s.</p><p>Attorneys for the city of Chicago’s attorneys and the other defendants in Hood’s civil rights have argued that Schmidle’s testimony is essential, using a theory that puts Schmidle at the center of the action.</p><p>The defendants’ attorneys have argued that Hood’s civil rights were not violated because he actually is guilty of murder and his murder conviction should not have been vacated. They argue that journalists like Schmidle were tricked into writing a false narrative, which in turn prompted Governor Quinn to commute Hood’s sentence and pressure the state attorney’s office to get Hood’s conviction thrown out.</p><p>The current status of the Feb. 22 document subpoena is somewhat unclear. After Schmidle’s attorneys objected to the subpoena in March, the defendants never moved to compel Schmidle to turn over the documents. In effect, they dropped the subpoena. But on July 10, Schmidle received another copy of the document subpoena by email. Once again, Schmidle refused to turn over the documents and the defendants didn’t bother to press the matter.</p><p>Schmidle’s attorneys did not ask the judge to quash the document subpoena, but only because it seemed like the defendants had already given up on that one.</p><p>“Defendants have not moved to compel responses to the Document Subpoena, and therefore it is not at issue in this motion,” they wrote in the July 23 motion to quash the deposition subpoenas. That motion to quash was granted<a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/12/hood-v-city-of-chicago/""> in October</a>.</p><p>Through a New Yorker spokeswoman, Schmidle declined to comment.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2019-11-08_at_12.56.4.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,<p>A portion of the subpoena outlining broad requests for reporter Nicholas Schmidle&#x27;s work product</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,journalist communications or work product,['DROPPED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,Nicholas Schmidle,,,,,,,,,

Every time he has re-entered the U.S. since the beginning of 2019, he says, he has been pulled aside for a secondary screening.

Then his notebooks were searched.<br/></p><p>One of his reporter notebooks included notes and information about the process of filing a Freedom of Information Act request, which he intended to do for his work.</p><p>“The officer took exception to this, and asked me why I was interested in filing FOIAs,” Rapalo said. “I told him, because I’m a journalist, and it’s one of the tools we have.”</p><p>Rapalo said during this border stop in Miami, an official who seemed to “like him” indicated that these stops would be an ongoing problem. “He said I could try Global Entry to make this go faster next time.”<br/></p><p>Global Entry is a government program for expediting international travel.<br/></p><p>Like the previous incidents, Rapalo said the secondary screenings began with about 30 minutes of questioning, then he was held for 1-2 hours while his luggage was searched.

A computer program used to identify insider threats flagged suspicious activity on his work computer last fall, Lieutenant Commander Scott McBride, a service spokesman, <a href=""https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-coast-guard-maryland-attack-0222-story.html"">told the Baltimore Sun</a>.</p><p>McBride said that Hasson was arrested once Federal Bureau of Investigation and Coast Guard investigators were “confident in the strength of the evidence supporting the criminal complaint and warrant,” the The Sun reported.</p><p>Law enforcement officers executed a search warrant on his basement apartment in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Silver Spring, Maryland, and seized 15 firearms, two silencers, over 100 pills of the opioid painkiller tramadol, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Officers also found a spreadsheet listing potential targets, including MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough and CNN’s Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo and Van Jones.</p><p>Prosecutors say Hasson used his government computer to plot an assault, researching potential locations to target politicians and studying the writings of domestic terrorists including the Unabomber and the Virginia Tech shooter, The Washington Post <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/ex-coast-guard-lieutenant-ordered-held-for-14-days-while-government-weighs-terrorism-related-charges-in-his-planning-of-widespread-terrorist-attack/2019/02/21/57918f12-3573-11e9-854a-7a14d7fec96a_story.html?utm_term=.4d03949a4fb4"">reported</a>.</p><p>In documents recovered from Hasson’s computer, he described himself as a “long time White Nationalist.” The Post reported that according to court documents, Hasson called for “focused violence” to “establish a white homeland.”</p><p>“The sheer number and force of the weapons recovered from Mr. Hasson’s residence in this case, coupled with the disturbing nature of his writing, appear to reflect a very significant threat to the safety of our community,” Robert Hur, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, told The Sun, “particularly given the position of trust that Mr. Hasson held with the United States government.”</p><p>A grand jury indicted Hasson on Feb. 27 on charges of illegal possession of firearm silencers, possession of firearms by a drug addict and unlawful user, and possession of a controlled substance. His court hearing has not yet been scheduled, but Hasson has been detained since his arrest on Feb. 15.</p><p>Prosecutors told The Post that Hasson could face up to 31 years in prison if convicted: 10 years for each of the weapons charges and one year for the possession of tramadol.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

A bunch of people were yelling about getting shoved.”</p><p>McLeod said that the Capitol Police officers physically prevented reporters from interviewing senators, even though the senators were willing to talk to the press.</p><p>“I have never seen them do what they did today, which was forming a protective circle around senators to keep press away,” he said. “The senators were just walking in to a vote like normal and the police were doing it to everyone. There was no sign the senators were requesting it.”</p><p>Laslo, one of the reporters who was shoved,<a href=""https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/capitol-police-crackdown-press-escalates-physical-altercation""> gave a similar account</a> to the political news site Roll Call.</p><p>“[Sen. Dianne] Feinstein was doing an interview with one reporter, and she just stopped and her jaw just dropped,” Laslo said. “She was confused. She was just unable to keep doing an interview that she wanted to do because the officers were creating such a mess.”</p><p>Roll Call, which obtained a recording of the altercation, reported that a Capitol Police officer could be heard telling journalists that they were violating the law.</p><p>“That’s a violation,” the Capitol Police officer reportedly said to the reporters walking alongside the senators. “Surrounding them — we lock people up for that. If the public does that, they get locked up.”</p><p>Both McLeod and Laslo said that the Capitol Police officers’ aggressive tactics were unprecedented.</p><p>“There were no more reporters there than there are any day of any week,” McLeod said.</p><p>“This was first time any officer put their hands on me or my co-workers in front of me, so it was really disheartening,” Laslo told Roll Call.</p><p>The Feb. 14 altercation came in the midst of heated confrontations between members of Congress and journalists.</p><p>The day before, Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez accused Henry Rodgers, a reporter from the right-wing news site The Daily Caller, of harassing him and threatened to call the police.</p><p>“I won’t answer questions to the Daily Caller, period!” Menendez said,<a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/menendez-threatens-to-call-capitol-police-after-reporter-asks-him-about-green-new-deal""> according to Rodgers’ recording</a> of the conversation. “You’re trash … Don’t keep harassing me anymore or I’ll race to the Capitol Police!”</p><p>Menendez did not follow through on his threat to involve the Capitol Police.</p><p>On Feb. 14, Roll Call reports, the Capitol Police were on high alert after receiving reports that a certain individual — a former journalist and political tracker with a reputation for aggressively confronting conservative politicians — had been spotted in the area.</p><p>McLeod said that the presence of the political tracker shouldn’t excuse the Capitol Police’s aggressive treatment of the press in the Senate basement.</p><p>“Looks like it was all an absurd over-reaction because this [political tracker] was apparently somewhere around,” he said. “But the thing is he can&#x27;t get into the actual capitol and that is where this took place. We were in an area past a security checkpoint where you needed to have ID or be a guest of someone to get in. So the whole thing made no sense.”</p><p>The National Press Club also<a href=""https://www.press.org/news-multimedia/news/national-press-club-criticizes-capitol-police-manhandling-reporters""> released a statement</a> criticizing the Capitol Police response as an over-reaction.</p><p>“Capitol Police dramatically over-reacted on Thursday and did more harm than good when they prevented accredited reporters from doing their job and further obstructed senators from communicating with the press,” NPC president Alison Fitzgerald Kodjak said in a statement. “There was no call for the police to shove or place their hands on the reporters.”</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Jenna Garland, press secretary for former Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, was cited with two violations of the act and is accused of ordering a subordinate in the city’s Department of Watershed Management to delay handing over public records containing information damaging to Reed and other city officials in March 2017.</p><p>On March 7, 2017, WSB-TV Channel 2 Action News filed a records request for “billing, payment and usage records,” according to the citation. It alleges that Garland “knowingly and willingly attempt[ed] to frustrate the access to records not subject to exemption” by instructing then-watershed spokeswoman Lillian Govus via text message to “[d]rag this out as long as possible [a]nd provide information in the most confusing format available.”</p><p>The second citation alleges that Garland similarly obstructed a second records request from Channel 2, filed on March 21, 2017, when Garland instructed Govus to “‘[h]old all’ documents responsive to the request until the requestor asked for an update” via text message on April 7, 2017.</p><p>The texts were obtained and <a href=""https://www.ajc.com/news/local/action-needed-texts-show-kasim-reed-role-records-request/ayGINvRtGAjp1CgjlLwNoO/"">reported</a> on by Channel 2 and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in May 2018.</p><p>It is exceedingly rare for a public official to face consequences for obstructing public records requests, Jonathan Peters, media law professor at the University of Georgia, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. “It’s not uncommon for state records laws to have those penalties built in to them,” he said. “What is really uncommon is to see a prosecutor actually use them.”</p><p>Peters said public records law violations aren’t often worthwhile for prosecutors to pursue given the challenge of securing a conviction under one of the criminal provisions of the law. “Good faith” is a defense built into many open records laws, including Georgia’s ORA.</p><p>“A good faith defense is so elastic and subjective that it’s not a terribly difficult defense for a public official to make,” Peters said.</p><p>When cases are pursued, he said, it is when the violations are so flagrant that they can’t be ignored.</p><p>“I think it’s the particularly bad facts of this case, where screenshots of the actual text messages are so clearly evidence of an effort to frustrate the public records law, that it is reasonably impossible to look at the behavior of Jenna Garland and see anything resembling good faith,” Peters said.</p><p>Violations of the ORA are misdemeanors, and if convicted Garland faces up to a $1,000 fine. She could also face up to a $2,500 fine for the second citation, depending on how the judge decides to hear the allegations.</p><p>“Openness and transparency in government are vital to upholding the public trust,” Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said in a news release on the citations on Feb. 11, 2019. “I am confident that this action sends a clear message that the Georgia Open Records Act will be enforced.”</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

BGA detailed the context of this order in an <a href=""https://www.bettergov.org/news/cook-judge-bars-publication-of-documents-about-student-drowning-raising-free-press-concerns"">article</a> published on Feb. 7, 2019.</p><p>The article reported that a CPS lawyer supplied BGA with requested investigative files and internal records on Jan. 24. Four days later, the school’s lawyers asked for their return and the destruction of any copies that had been made, claiming that their release had been a mistake.</p><p>The lawsuit and files pertained to a 2017 BGA and Chicago Sun-Times <a href=""https://www.bettergov.org/news/autistic-teens-death-in-cps-pool-heightens-questions-of-special-ed-care"">investigation</a> which revealed that a 14-year-old boy with autism was permitted to enter a school pool with neither direct supervision nor a life vest. They reported that the boy drowned within minutes.</p><p>When BGA refused to return the released files, CPS attorney Mara Warman asked Circuit Court Judge Peter Flynn during a hearing on Feb. 4 to “claw back” the records. Flynn ruled in their favor, ordering that BGA delay publishing the records until at least Feb. 20. Following an emergency request from BGA to vacate that order, Flynn reaffirmed his ruling on Feb 6.</p><p>“Just hold your horses,” Flynn said during the second hearing, BGA reported. “There is no emergency here in any meaningful way… I don’t think it’s a prior restraint. I think it’s efficient management of a case.”</p><p>BGA attorney Matt Topic disagreed. “You have the press, which has a highly relevant, important document that they obtained through nothing illegal and you are restraining them from publishing that document where they have an ethical and professional obligation,” Topic said.</p><p>Bob Secter, senior editor for BGA, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that Topic reached out to the deceased child’s parents to have them sign a paper authorizing the release of the materials. Based on that release, Flynn vacated his order to delay publication. Some of the documents did have the names of child witnesses to the incident redacted, as well as their social security numbers and other private information.</p><p>BGA published an <a href=""https://www.bettergov.org/news/chicago-public-schools-to-pay-4m-in-special-ed-teens-drowning"">article</a> on Feb. 8 about the judge vacating the original order and what was in the documents.</p><p>“This started as a simple FOIA case,” Secter told the Tracker about BGA’s use of the Freedom of Information Act. “We wrote a story with the Chicago Sun-Times reconstructing that incident and how it came about and who might have been responsible and who made mistakes. As part of the reporting on that, we issued a FOIA… As the Chicago Public School does, they basically blanket deny everything, so we filed a lawsuit, and they fought us for well over a year.”</p><p>The child’s parents had also sued CPS for wrongful death, reaching a $4 million settlement which was approved by the Illinois Board of Education the day before the documents requested in the FOIA were released to BGA.</p><p>“[The prior restraint] was entirely out of the ordinary. Outside of national security cases this doesn’t happen, and, not to minimize what we did, but it was an everyday case about a tragic accident and the subsequent legal case,” Secter said.</p><p>U.S. Supreme Court precedent has held that prior restraint—in which government officials seek to block information from becoming public—is <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/prior_restraint"">unconstitutional</a> in all but the most extreme circumstances.<br/></p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Bloom is pushing back on the subpoena, claiming that reporter’s privilege protects him from disclosure of unpublished materials.</p><p>The subpoena, dated Feb. 4, 2019, orders Bloom to produce numerous reporting materials, communications, and documents by Feb. 22.</p><p>The subpoena was issued as part of a <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/ex-trump-aide-jason-miller-hires-hulk-hogans-lawyers-to-sue-gizmodo-over-abortion-pill-story"">$100 million lawsuit filed</a> by Miller against Gizmodo Media Group and its reporter Katherine Krueger over <a href=""https://splinternews.com/court-docs-allege-ex-trump-staffer-drugged-woman-he-got-1829233105"">an article Kruger authored</a> for Splinter News.

The DOJ <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/leak-investigations-rise-800-under-jeff-sessions"">has indicated they have dozens more</a> leak investigations active, and the Trump DOJ is on pace to prosecute more sources of journalists than any other administration before it.</p><p>According to the criminal complaint unsealed on Feb. 21, 2019, DOJ has accused Fry of searching for Cohen’s name and company in two government financial databases, downloading “suspicious activity reports,” or SARs, and sending information he found to attorney Michael Avenatti, who has represented adult entertainer Stormy Daniels in her accusations against President Trump, as well as an unidentified reporter at the New Yorker.</p><p>In May 2018, the New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow published an investigation into Cohen’s suspicious overseas financial transactions that may have related to 2016 election activities, titled “<a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/missing-files-motivated-the-leak-of-michael-cohens-financial-records"">Missing Files Motivated Leak of Michael Cohen’s Financial Records</a>.” The title and quotes from the article match those cited in the complaint.</p><p>In the article, an unidentified source is quoted by Farrow justifying why it was important that the public know about Cohen’s suspicious financial transactions: “‘I have never seen something pulled off the system. . . . That system is a safeguard for the bank. It’s a stockpile of information. When something’s not there that should be, I immediately became concerned.’ The official added, ‘That’s why I came forward.’”</p><p>The DOJ claims it obtained WhatsApp messages between Fry and the unidentified reporter, assumed to be Farrow. It is unclear how the DOJ obtained these messages, or whether the DOJ has attempted to access communications records directly from Farrow or any other reporters potentially connected to this case.</p></div></div>

It also stated that the possession of the spreadsheet was a misdemeanor, and demanded that the records be destroyed.</p><p>“If you do not intend to comply with our request, the Department can take legal action to ensure that the spreadsheets are properly deleted and not disseminated,” <a href=""https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/02/26/california-keeps-a-secret-list-of-criminal-cops-but-says-you-cant-have-it/"">reads the letter</a> from Becerra’s office.</p><p>Both Lewis and Paladino confirmed to Freedom of the Press Foundation that they have no intention of destroying the list.</p><p>David Snyder, an attorney at the First Amendment Coalition, noted the presence of two distinct legal threats in the letter: criminal charges for possessing the list, and a court order, such as an injunction, to prevent publication of it.</p><p>“As for the first, which says that it’s a misdemeanor to possess the list, the Supreme Court has made clear that if a journalist or anyone else lawfully receives information, they are protected from civil liability for publishing it,” Snyder said.</p><p>In a statement provided to Freedom of the Press Foundation, a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice repeated that the information Paladino and Lewis obtained is confidential and was released only inadvertently.</p><p>“It’s not like someone clicked ‘send’ on the wrong thing! They did that the first time!” Paladino told Freedom of the Press Foundation, noting that POST released an unrelated document to the reporters before correcting the mistake and sending the responsive record.</p><p>Paladino and Lewis have not published the list itself, though a report in the East Times Bay about the legal threat used several examples of California police officers convicted of crimes.</p><p>“Part of the reason we haven’t published is to do due diligence,” Lewis said.</p><p>Freedom of the Press Foundation followed up with the attorney general’s office to clarify whether it recognized any of the serious First Amendment concerns with the letter, and received a statement through a spokesperson from Attorney General Becerra. His response included no reference to the First Amendment:</p><p>“We always strive to balance the public’s right to know, the need to be transparent and an individual’s right to privacy. In this case, information from a database that’s required by law to be confidential was released erroneously, jeopardizing personal data of individuals across our state. No one wants to shield criminal behavior; we’re subject to the rule of law.”</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Under Illinois law, the party seeking to do so must prove such information being sought would be relevant to the proceeding, that such information is in the public interest, and that they have exhausted all other means of obtaining that information. “There is no public interest supported by disclosing the contents of the Plaintiff’s Dropbox Account other than to simply go on an improper fishing expedition for some undisclosed and unknown reason,” the motion continues.</p><p>Neither Kraft nor his attorney received a copy of the subpoena via electronic or postal mail, and did not become aware of its existence until a third party provided it to them on Feb. 8, according to the motion. Also on that day, James Kelly, the lawyer for Algonquin Township, wrote a letter to the lawyer for Edgar County Watchdogs stating that the subpoena was “rejected and cannot be served,” and so there was no need to file the emergency motion to quash the subpoena.

Belin told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that she first sought information about press credentials in the Iowa House of Representatives in early 2019. Since then, officials have denied her requests for credentials or access to press work areas multiple times, each time citing different reasons that did not align with written policies in place. Both the House and the Senate have also changed press qualification criteria since her first application.</p><p>When Belin first sought credentials in the House, the clerk at the time, Carmine Boal, told her by email on Jan. 3, 2019, that credentials “are not issued to members of the public.”</p><p>Boal referenced Iowa House rules, which did not elaborate on qualifications for the press. She also told Belin the House consulted<a href=""https://periodical.house.gov/accreditation/rules-and-regulations""> U.S. congressional press gallery rules</a>, which would not appear to disqualify Belin. Boal never responded to multiple requests for further explanation from Belin.</p><p>Boal stood by the denial of Belin’s credentials in a statement <a href=""https://apnews.com/df3c7ecdcf90431daf729a1fb7ac7fe4"">to The Associated Press</a> but did not elaborate on why she did not meet the chamber’s rules that restricted access to the press box to “representatives of the press, radio, and television.”</p><p>After the Iowa Freedom of Information Council wrote to Boal expressing concerns about Belin’s rejection, Boal responded on Feb. 5 that House rules “do not offer a definition” of members of the media, and again pointed to congressional rules. In a copy of the response letter provided to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, she wrote that online outlets are not excluded and said that credentials are not denied based on content. However, she also said that the House has not “credentialed any ‘non-traditional media’ since 2015,” a policy that did not appear in writing.</p><p>Belin also applied for access to desks reserved for members of the press in the Iowa Senate in January 2019. She was initially told that she could access vacant spaces on day passes. However, Belin said she was never issued a day pass, even when the desks were not in use</p><p>Both the House and the Senate updated their press policies after Belin’s initial inquiries, according to the <a href=""https://apnews.com/64d897b25c9c8918d5be95f5e63797a8"">AP</a>. The House updated its<a href=""https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/CCDOC/1050120.pdf""> policy</a> in February 2019 to include requirements that credentialed press be “bona fide correspondents of repute” and a “paid correspondent.” Bleeding Heartland is editorially independent and a registered business. Belin, as its owner, is entitled to any proceeds.</p><p>Belin applied for press credentials for the 2020 legislative session. She was denied credentials from the House on Jan. 10, 2020. House Clerk Meghan Nelson told her in an email that the House does not credential “outlets that are nontraditional/independent in nature.” This requirement is not included in the Iowa House press policy.</p><p>The Senate abolished media credentials and adopted a new <a href=""https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/SSDOC/1126281.pdf"">reserved work space policy</a>, in place for the 2020 legislative session, which guides access to desks in the Senate chamber reserved for media and Senate staff.</p><p>On Jan. 10, Belin received an email from Secretary of the Senate Charlie Smithson notifying her that “it has been determined that you do not meet the criteria to be a ‘member of the media’” under the Senate’s work space policy. Correspondence provided by Belin shows that Smithson did not respond to her multiple requests for further explanation of what criteria she did not meet under the policy.</p><p>Belin told the Tracker that press freedom protections are not just for journalists pulling a full-time salary. She suspects she was denied access because her approach differs from the “traditional objectivity stance.”</p><p>“I don’t think it’s constitutional for them to exclude me because they don’t like the opinions on my website,” Belin said.</p><p>Iowa House and Senate officials did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/LauraBelinheadshot.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,"<p>Political blogger Laura Belin has been repeatedly denied press access to the Iowa Statehouse. &quot;I don’t think it’s constitutional for them to exclude me because they don’t like the opinions on my website,” Belin said.</p>",None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,Laura Belin,,,,,,,,,

A federal magistrate judge quashed the subpoena on Aug. 9, and a federal district court judge affirmed that decision on Nov. 12.</p><p>Michael Johnson, the plaintiff, alleges in his civil lawsuit filed in November 2016 that he was discriminated against at FDNY due to his status as an African American &quot;priority hire&quot; who joined the department in 2014. He was hired following a court order to remedy historically discriminatory hiring practices at FDNY. Johnson alleges that he was the subject of strategic leaks to the media intended to portray him as a coward who refused to fight fires.</p><p>Edelman was the co-author of a May 2015 New York Post story titled &quot;Firefighters fear colleague who routinely flees fires.&quot; The piece began, &quot;He&#x27;s a firefighter in name only. Michael D. Johnson won&#x27;t fight fires. Instead, he stays on the sidelines as his Engine Company 257 colleagues rush into burning buildings, FDNY insiders told the Post.&quot;</p><p>The 2019 subpoena was issued demanding Edelman appear at a Jan. 29 deposition at the New York office of one of Johnson&#x27;s attorneys. After negotiations with Johnson&#x27;s attorneys and several extensions granted by the court, Edelman&#x27;s attorneys filed a motion to quash the subpoena on June 4.</p><p>Edelman penned an affidavit in support of the motion, in which she argues the importance of keeping the identities of her sources confidential. &quot;My reporting for the Post includes investigating corruption, waste, and misconduct within government agencies in New York City,&quot; she writes. &quot;The municipal government sources who provide me information on these and other issues could be subject to serious professional discipline—or even lose their job—for speaking with me. It is therefore absolutely critical that my sources trust that I will maintain their confidentiality.&quot;</p><p>Lawyers for Johnson argued in court filings that Edelman had waived her reporter&#x27;s privilege because she, in a 2015 phone call with one of Johnson’s attorneys, mentioned she was getting a call on another line from Jake Lemonda, a FDNY battalion chief. Edelman&#x27;s attorney, Robert Balin, disagreed, writing in a filing, &quot;Ms. Edelman said nothing about the substance of any conversations she had with Mr. Lemonda, whether he provided her with any information, or if he did, whether any information he provided was used in—or even connected to—the Article.&quot;</p><p>Vera M. Scanlon, a federal magistrate judge, granted the order quashing the subpoena on Aug. 9. The plaintiff’s counsel filed an objection to Scanlon&#x27;s order, writing that the judge &quot;erred when she found that all of Edelman&#x27;s discussions with her sources were confidential&quot; and that the &quot;standard for non-confidentiality ought to apply.&quot;</p><p>On Nov. 12, U.S. District Court Judge Kiyo A.

The second stop included a search of his equipment.</p><p>The filmmaker, a foreign citizen who is based in the U.S., told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that in December 2018 he was crossing the San Ysidro border near San Diego, California, when <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/independent-filmmaker-stopped-while-crossing-us-mexico-border/"">he was stopped and held</a> for several hours after being recognized for his work by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent.</p><p>Not quite a week later, he said, he was stopped at the same border point while re-entering Mexico to continue his work.</p><p>About 1 a.m. on Sunday, Jan. 6, 2019, a CBP agent took the passports of the filmmaker and a friend with whom he was traveling.</p><p>Usually, the filmmaker said, a secondary screening has a specific protocol: The agent puts the passport in an orange slip and tucks the slip under a wiper on the front windshield. This time, he said, the protocol was very different.</p><p>The agent kept the two passports, asked the filmmaker for his wallet and told him and his friend to leave the car. The filmmaker was then taken inside the CBP office, where he waited for 30-40 minutes.</p><p>Plainclothes officers began asking questions, he said, most notably about if he’d been in any face-off with officers or if he had any involvement in a specific New Year’s Eve incident. On Dec. 31, 2018, CBP agents <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/border-patrol-migrants-tear-gas-mexico-1276529"">fired tear gas across the border</a> near Tijuana, Mexico.</p><p>The filmmaker also said the agents asked if he “knew of any group or people who were agitators.”</p><p>The filmmaker said he answered the questions and then the agents asked him to unlock his phone. He did so, he said, because he didn’t want to escalate the situation and get into a confrontation with the agents.</p><p>“By this time it’s almost 2 a.m.,” the filmmaker said, “And the whole situation is intimidating.”</p><p>After about 15 minutes with his phone, the agents returned and asked him to unlock it again. They also asked for his email and phone number.</p><p>“I don’t think anything was missing from my phone,” the filmmaker said, “But they had full access to everything — my contacts, my photos, my social media.”</p><p>All told, he said, he was held for about 2 hours. His friend’s car was searched and she was brought in and questioned as well.</p><p>The filmmaker said he has no plans to go back because he is done filming. He did ask that his name not be used for fear of reprisal.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has detailed <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/border-stop/?categories=5&amp;tags=102"">nearly a dozen border stops</a> of journalists following the migrant caravan.

Every time he has re-entered the U.S. since then, he says, he has been pulled aside for a secondary screening, in what Rapalo calls his “new routine.”</p><p>Rapalo believes that a flag or marker has been placed on his travel documents because border officials have consistently stopped him only after scanning his passport. The Jan. 5 secondary screening was his first time to be pulled aside—he was also stopped for <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/journalist-stopped-border-second-time-camera-searched/"">additional screening on Jan. 26</a> and <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/journalist-stopped-border-third-time-questioned-about-his-work-and-foia-request/"">Feb. 16</a>, where the photos on his camera were searched and he was questioned about public records requests he intends to file.</p><p>“The first question was, ‘Why did you have trouble at the border?’” Rapalo said, referring to his reporting on the US-Mexico border. “I don’t know how he could have even known that. And then they asked me about my work along the border.”</p><p>According to Rapalo, the secondary screening began with about 30 minutes of questioning, then he was held for 1-2 hours while his luggage was searched.</p><p>“They go through my reporter notebooks, receipts, and ask me about the nature of my work, and how long I’ve been doing the job and whether I do fake news,” he told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. “I tell them to Google me. It seems like they are trying to get information out of me related to the border, like gathering intelligence on why the media is interested in the border.”</p><p>Rapalo said that while reporting from Tijuana on New Year’s Eve 2018, officials with Customs and Border Protection accused him and other journalists of exploiting migrants for stories and even “bringing them here from the shelters.”</p><p>“CBP tells people at the border hoping to cross that the journalists are taking advantage of them, and that they are there to make money off of them,” Rapalo said.</p><p>He said he responded to these accusations by stating that, “I can’t speak for everyone else, but I’m just here to watch and witness.”</p><p>CBP did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Obviously, this scares off potential listeners as well as guests and experts we reach out to. In addition to this, it allows corporate media to refer to us as ‘foreign agents’ without clarifying what that means, which again creates a notion that we are spies of sort and not journalists.”</p><p>In a <a href=""https://www.cjr.org/analysis/fara-press.php"">2018 article for Columbia Journalism Review</a>, staff at the Committee to Protect Journalists wrote that “in invoking FARA, Congress is relying on a notoriously opaque unit within the Department of Justice to draw an impossible line between propaganda and journalism.

They asked me what I was doing in Tijuana, who I work for, what other outlets I’ve worked for, my editor’s phone number,” Drehsler said. “They also asked about my background as a photographer.” <br/><p><br/>She said that she was asked about what she knew about the caravan, people crossing the border illegally, and details about the shelters for migrants in Mexico. <br/><br/>“I didn’t hide anything, but I also didn’t give them information like the names of fellow journalists. And they also didn’t ask me for specific names.”<br/><br/>Drehsler told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that the border officials informed her that her passport had been “flagged,” but they did not know why, and they indicated that she might want to budget more time for border crossings since she could be stopped again.  <br/><br/>The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents did not search Drehsler’s notes, electronic devices, or baggage, and she was permitted to bring her phone into questioning.

The judge ultimately ruled that she could not be forced to reveal the source’s identity. <br/><br/>Bruce Bernstein, an employee at Rockmore Capital and the <a href=""http://www.teribuhl.com/2018/09/19/rockmore-capitals-bruce-bernstein-ex-wife-outs-him-for-possible-sec-violations-in-xspa-deal/"">subject of a story by Buhl on securities fraud</a>, filed a lawsuit alleging that Buhl had use a document in her reporting from his divorce filings that was under seal. </p><p>“Bernstein is entitled to pre-action discovery that will allow him to determine who - the Binn Parties, their counsel, Aufrichtig or a party currently unknown to Bernstein - sent the Document and email to Buhl,” reads the pre-discovery petition filed December 2018.<br/><br/>Manhattan Judge W. Franc Perry sealed the lawsuit, preventing the public from ascertaining the details of the lawsuit for months after it was filed.  <br/><br/>“I was still reporting on securities fraud, but I couldn’t report that they were suing me and bullying me,” Buhl told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. <br/><br/>On Jan. 18, Buhl wrote on her news website, Smashmouth Investigative Journalism, that a subject of her reporting was <a href=""http://www.teribuhl.com/2019/01/18/ny-court-case-putting-journalist-source-protection-at-risk/"">attempting to force her to disclose a source</a>, and that she was fighting back. <br/><br/>Buhl’s attorneys filed an opposition to the application to seal the records, and filed in support of the motion to dismiss the pre-action disclosure petition on Jan. 28. <br/><br/>“In a desperate bid to keep potentially damaging information from public view, Petitioner seeks to upend bedrock constitutional principles protecting both the public’s right to access the courts and the free exchange of ideas,” the opposition reads. “Petitioner has brought this special proceeding under CPLR 3102(c), in part, to compel Ms. Buhl, a seasoned investigative journalist, to reveal confidential source information relating to her reporting on Petitioner’s possible SEC violations.”<br/></p><p>On March 5, the judge ruled that Buhl could not be forced to disclose her confidential source. Buhl said that on the Friday before, March 1, the judge had ruled in favor of a motion by Buhl’s attorneys to unseal the case. </p><p>The dismissal of Bernstein’s petition for pre-discovery cites reporters’ ability to protect their sources:  “...[G]iven New York’s long tradition of protecting freedom of the press and recognizing the critical role that the press plays in our democratic society, Ms. Buhl, as a professional journalist, is protected by the Shield Law, which was enacted to provide the highest level of protection in the nation for those which gather and report the news and to promote the free flow of dissemination.” </p><p>On March 4, Buhl updated the post on her website to note that numerous news organizations and press freedom groups, including the New York Times and Reporters without Borders, had joined an amicus brief in support. </p><p>“This is an important win because it confirms that the New York shield law applies to freelance journalists like Teri Buhl, who self-publish on their own news sites,” said Sarah Matthews, staff attorney for Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which submitted <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-01-28-Anonymous-v-Anoymous-Teri-Buhl.pdf"">its own friend-of-the-court brief </a>in January. “Unsealing this case was particularly important because it involved an attempt to force a journalist to reveal her source.” </p><p>The Press Freedom Defense Fund provided the legal funding for Buhl’s case. (<i>Full disclosure: Matthews provides intake for the Fund and sits on the steering committee for the Tracker.</i>)</p><p>Buhl agreed that the judge’s ruling helps all freelancers in New York.</p><p>“It’s alarming that a state court judge even agreed to seal this case before any hearing took place, based on what one Wall Street lawyer said in his motion,” said Buhl said. “Pre-action discovery cannot be used as a fishing expedition to get reporters’ sources.” </p><p>Buhl also told the Tracker that she could think of no circumstance under which she would comply with such a legal order and reveal the identity of a source. </p><p>“I would rather be held in contempt,” she said. </p><p>Bernstein did not respond to request for comment by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p><p><i>— The<a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</a> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

The authorities let him cross, however, into the United States.</p><p>On the U.S. side, the filmmaker went into the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office to show an officer the error, and asked him to correct it. The officer started to until another agent said of him, “I know that guy—he’s in the video at the border.”</p><p>The officer was referring to a video taken of the journalist filming at the border. The video seemed to have been taken from a car, and in it, the filmmaker was clearly recognizable.</p><p>“I was following a family of migrants,” the filmmaker said, “And border patrol was trying to trip me up, trying to get me away from the family I was following.”</p><p>When CBP took away the family and pushed the filmmaker back, he said he gave them no resistance.</p><p>While inside the Customs office, a CBP officer told the filmmaker to sit down, that he’d “be there for hours,” and “a special team was going to come in.”</p><p>The officers continued re-watching the video, and the filmmaker waited for nearly 2 hours.

At the check-in counter, Farouky heard the employee who had his paperwork tell another employee, “I’ve got someone here relating to those two words that I can’t say.”</p><p>“I was like, what are those two words?” Farouky said. “Why would you say that in front of me?”</p><p>Whatever those two words were, Farouky was pulled aside for an interview by the Department of Homeland Security. He said the interview didn’t surprise him. While securing his visa for the trip, an embassy representative told him he might be interviewed again while traveling. Plus, he said, he is used to it.</p><p>“This time,” Farouky said, “This DHS guy showed up and questioned me for 10 minutes. There were some questions about my work, and also strange questions about whether I had family in the United States—he wanted to know if they were ‘OK,’ or if they had medical issues. When I mentioned living in Morocco in the past, he kept bringing up this story in which two Scandinavian hikers were killed by an ISIS affiliate. The story is horrifying, but he kept bringing it up over and over. It felt like maybe he was phishing to see my reaction.”</p><p>After he was told by DHS that he was good to go, Farouky said his luggage was given an additional swab to test for explosives, and then he boarded his flight to Florida. But upon landing, he said he was quickly pulled aside again.</p><p>“I sat there for a long time while someone asked me questions, and it focused on my travel history. He brought up Syria a lot, which I visited in 2009 before the United States’ cutoff date to visit the country.”</p><p>Farouky said a border agent then asked for his phone, and requested him to unlock it. The border officials did not ask him for his passcode.</p><p>“I didn’t know what my rights were,” Farouky said. “I asked, ‘What if I am not comfortable with that?’ And they said the only other option was sending my phone to a private company, which meant I wouldn’t get it back for weeks.”</p><p>Border agents <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/business/border-enforcement-airport-phones.html"">cannot force travelers to unlock their phones or laptops</a>, but they can ask them to do so and escalate the situation. If travelers refuse, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/business/border-enforcement-airport-phones.html"">officials can seize the devices and copy the data</a>.</p><p>Farouky said he was worried about his contacts, both personal and professional. “If they harvested all of the names and numbers, that’s everyone I have ever interviewed, so my sources could be put in some sort of database. But I didn’t feel like I had a choice.”</p><p>He said he felt intensely uncomfortable, but unlocked his phone and gave it to the officials. Farouky said they told him they were just looking for evidence of illegal activity. The border agents then took his phone into another room, returning it after about five minutes, Farouky said. When it was returned, it was on airplane mode.</p><p><a href=""https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/PIA-CBP%20-%20Border-Searches-of-Electronic-Devices%20-January-2018%20-%20Compliant.pdf"">A 2018 Customs and Border Protection directive</a> requires officials to ensure that prior to a search, devices are not connected to the internet, so that searches only involve content that is stored locally on the device.</p><p>Farouky also noted that at no point was he offered a piece of paper detailing his rights in the situation. He also said that he was concerned that pushing back would only spike the authorities’ interest in his devices and work.</p><p>“I certainly didn’t want them looking at my laptop. I’m not even doing hardcore investigative work,” he said.</p><p>DHS did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Farouky emphasized that this kind of incident is not uncommon for him, and that he has been questioned by authorities while traveling and asked to unlock his devices at other times. He said in a Tel Aviv airport around 2009, Israeli authorities asked him to unlock his phone and he refused. And a few years ago in New York, he was interrogated in what he called a much ruder and longer fashion. There, his phone was taken but not unlocked.</p><p>“I don’t have any doubt that this is because I am a Muslim, a Palestinian, and a journalist. It really pissed me off intellectually,” Farouky said.</p><p><i>— The </i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Sheets later <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx3UwzBgMRs"">posted the video</a> recorded by his body camera on YouTube.</p><p>The video shows Sheets entering the City Hall Annex building and going to the city clerk’s office, where he makes a request for a copy of the ordinance. Two city hall staffers who appear on the video tell Sheets that they do not have their permission and film them and ask him to stop recording.</p><p>“You don’t have our permission to record us,” one of the staffers tells Sheets.</p><p>“You’re a public official in a public building,” Sheets replies.</p><p>“This is a staff area,” the staffer says. “It’s not a public meeting area.”</p><p>Later in the video, Sheets goes to the Punta Gorda police station and asks to speak with the police chief. An officer, later identified as Lt. Justin Davoult, then approaches him in the lobby to inform them that the police chief will not speak with him. Davoult also issues two trespass warnings to Sheets, which ban Sheets from returning to Punta Gorda City Hall and City Hall Annex for one year.</p><p>“Before we go any further, this is what we’re going to do,” Davoult tells Sheets in the video. “The chief’s not available to speak to you. OK, so this is what you’ve got. This is a trespass warning for City Hall and City Annex, OK, for both addresses over at City Hall. You are no longer to be at or on that property for a period of one year or you will face arrest.”<br/></p></div></div>

More than two dozen newsrooms receive hoax bomb threats,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/more-two-dozen-newsrooms-receive-hoax-bomb-threats/,2019-01-24 16:11:01.981235+00:00,2019-01-24 16:11:01.981235+00:00,2019-01-24 16:11:01.925589+00:00,,,Other Incident,,,,,2018-12-13,False,Multiple media outlets,None,None,"<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Becky Maxwell, publisher at the Journal Express in Knoxville, Iowa, received an email on Dec. 13, 2018, claiming that a bomb had been placed in newspaper’s building that would detonate if she failed to send a ransom in bitcoin by the end of business. The Express was one of 12 newspapers owned by the media company CNHI to receive such a threat that day.<br/></p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has documented that at least 27 U.S. media outlets were targeted with the hoax bomb threats, alongside hundreds of schools, businesses and public buildings across the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In addition to the CNHI (formerly Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc.) papers, eight stations owned by Gray TV and two newspapers owned by McClatchy received the email threats. More may have received the email hoax and not publicized it. <br/></p><p>“When I first received [the email],” Maxwell told the Tracker, “I read it a couple of times and I thought, ‘Oh, this is just a scam.’” But, because of previous incidents over the past 15 years, she said, they now take any kind of threat seriously.<br/></p><p>After consulting with the chief of police, the Express did not evacuate. Neither did the staff at the Joplin Globe in Joplin, Missouri. When reporters Debby Woodin and Emily Younker each received the threatening email, they brought it to Globe Editor Carol Stark and the publisher, who immediately called the police. While the Globe has policies in place for tornadoes and fires, Stark told the Tracker, on the day they received the threat they lacked a clear procedure to follow. <br/></p><p>“We did not evacuate because the police really thought it was a bogus call, but in hindsight now we should have,” she said.<br/></p><p>Events over the past year have spurred many newsrooms across the country to reevaluate their security infrastructure and procedures, <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/blog/panic-buttons-cameras-and-gun-under-desk-local-newsrooms-update-security-wake-capital-gazette-attack/"">editors and publishers told the Tracker</a>, and none more so than the June shooting at a newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland. On June 28, Jarrod Ramos entered the Capital Gazette offices and <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/man-upset-newspaper-coverage-shoots-and-kills-multiple-journalists-capital-gazette-newsroom/"">shot to death five people</a>, including four journalists and a sales associate.<br/></p><p>Andy Bernhard, publisher for The Park Record in Park City, Utah, said that when his newsroom received the bomb threat they were already in the process of following through with recommendations from the county sheriff for improvements to the office’s physical security.<br/></p><p>“It was actually the Annapolis Capital incident that got us moving on evolving our security procedures,” he said. “We’re actively receiving quotes for specifically that: shatterproof glass, keycard entry and new security cameras.”<br/></p><p>Media companies, including CNHI and Swift Communications, have also initiated security reviews and updates in the wake of the Annapolis shooting, including conducting active shooter training with the full staff at each of their outlets.<br/></p><p>On July 10, McClatchy sent an internal email, shared with the Tracker, informing its newsrooms that all locations would have hostile intruder trainings and that it was evaluating and updating the emergency plans and physical security of all locations. The email stated: “These upgrades may include installing panic buttons, remote entry maglocks, video cameras in entryways, shatter-resistant film coating to windows and additional on-site security guards.” <br/></p><p>Jeanne Segal, McClatchy communications director, told the Tracker that all trainings and physical upgrades have been completed.<br/></p><p>Al Lancaster, VP general manager at WSAW-TV in Wausau, Wisconsin, was glad that the threat came in in the middle of the day, when four department heads were in the newsroom and able to clear the building in fewer than 10 minutes. Lancaster told the Tracker, “It was pretty clear that we should evacuate whether we thought the threat was legitimate or not.”<br/></p><p>Lancaster said that the bomb hoax checked their preparedness for such an event.<br/></p><p>“We did just pull our disaster plan which had not been updated for a while,” Lancaster said, “And because of that bomb scare actually we’re looking at it with our department heads and revising and tweaking some things.”<br/></p><p>In a year that saw an increase of violence and threats against journalists, this single-day email bomb hoax tested security procedures and trainings that newsrooms across the country have undertaken. </p></div></div>

 and a Misdemeanor class A charge will be filed for the threat made 
against an employee of D Magazine.  A DPD CAD Bolo was entered on the 
suspect for situational awareness.  An information bulletin was also 
disseminated by Fusion to all DPD officers. On
 November 15, 2018, DPD took the subject in custody for a DPD alias 
warrant. The subject was interviewed at headquarters.  The investigation
 is on-going.  I will contact Intelligence for any further updates.</p></div>

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Although
 Anderson’s email, which the councilman forwarded to Brown, stated that 
charges would be filed against Taylor, no charges were ever filed. <br/></p><p>On Nov. 26, shortly after Brown <a href=""https://twitter.com/BarrettBrown_/status/1067138293895229440"">tweeted out excerpts</a> of Anderson’s email, D Magazine <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20181127024137/https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2018/11/bomb-threat-made-against-d-magazine-and-j-erik-jonsson-library/"">published a post</a>
 about the bomb threat. A few days later, the post was abruptly deleted 
without any explanation. Rogers told the Tracker that he could not 
comment on what had happened.</p><p>For months, Brown continued to try to get more information about the police investigation. On Dec. 5, he <a href=""https://twitter.com/BarrettBrown_/status/1070352725651660803"">spoke at a city council meeting</a>
 and asked the mayor to explain why he had never been notified about the
 bomb threat. On Feb. 24, 2019, he sent assistant police chief Anderson 
copies of more evidence he had dug up on Taylor — screenshots of 
Facebook messages that Taylor had sent to Brown’s girlfriend asking 
about him, and photos from Taylor’s Instagram page that shows him posing
 with a gun. He also <a href=""https://twitter.com/BarrettBrown_/status/1099472077994844163"">posted the photos and screenshots</a> on Facebook and Twitter. In response, a former DPD officer <a href=""https://twitter.com/BarrettBrown_/status/1099622048094134273"">left a comment</a> saying that Brown “has a smug, punchable face.”</p><p>On
 Feb. 26, Brown spoke with Sheldon Smith, a DPD sergeant overseeing the 
investigation, about the current status of the case. In the 
conversation, which Brown recorded, Smith told Brown that the DPD 
investigated the bomb threats against the Dallas library and D Magazine,
 but ultimately determined that there was not enough evidence to charge 
Taylor.</p><p>“Initially,
 we believed that we would have enough information to file those charges
 on the individual that we’re talking about, just based on the 
preliminary information,” Smith told Brown, according to a recording of 
the conversation. “But after we conducted a thorough investigation, we 
didn't have the elements needed in order to actually file the offense 
for that.”</p><p>Smith
 offered two explanations for why charges could not be brought against 
Taylor. First, he said, Taylor had never said that he would personally 
blow up D Magazine’s building, just that “someone” could.</p><p>“He
 didn’t say that he would,” Smith said, according to the recording. “And
 the element we needed was if he had said, ‘I’m going to blow the 
building up.’ But when he said ‘someone,’ that’s why we couldn’t 
physically charge him.”</p><p>Brown
 pointed out that this explanation couldn’t account for the decision not
 to charge him for the bomb threat against the Dallas library, which 
contains the explicit statement, “I’m gonna blow your fucking library 
up.”</p><p>To
 that, Smith offered a second explanation for not charging Taylor. The 
problem, he said, was that the police could not be sure that Taylor was 
actually responsible for the threat posted from his Facebook account.</p><p>“We
 did extensive research on his Facebook account and we could not confirm
 that it was actually him that said that,” Smith said, according to the 
recording. “It may have been him, but we weren’t 100 percent sure that 
it was him. It would be as if you left your phone sitting on the counter
 and someone’s gonna send messages from your number.”</p><p>Brown
 is an independent journalist, essayist, and media critic who is best 
known for his close association with the online movement Anonymous. 
Although Brown is not a computer hacker, he embedded himself as a 
journalist with a hacker collective tied to Anonymous. In 2012, as 
federal authorities stepped up operations against the hacking group, the
 FBI raided Brown’s house and his mother’s house.</p><p>Later that year, <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2012/09/barret-brown-raid/"">Brown was arrested</a>
 for allegedly threatening one of the FBI agents who had raided his 
mother’s house. In 2013, a federal grand jury indicted Brown on a number
 of charges related to trafficking in stolen information, for allegedly 
linking to information that hackers had already stolen. Most of the 
federal charges <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2014/03/barrett-brown-motion-to-dismiss/"">were later dropped</a>, and Brown ultimately <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2014/04/barrett-brown-plea-agreement/"">accepted a plea deal</a> and was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/22/barrett-brown-trial-warns-dangerous-precedent-hacking-sentencing"">sentenced to five years in prison</a>. While incarcerated, he wrote a <a href=""https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2016/02/barrett-brown-wins-a-national-magazine-award-from-behind-bars/"">National Magazine Award-winning column</a> on prison life.

But before Alexander could ask a question, Trump went off on a rant about Acosta.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them,&quot; the president said, pointing at Acosta. &quot;You are a rude, terrible person.

A free press is vital to democracy, and we stand behind Jim Acosta and his fellow journalists everywhere.&quot;</p><p>Even as mainstream journalists came to Acosta&#x27;s defense, far-right media and political figures began to adopt a different narrative — that Acosta had been violent toward the intern who tried to grab his microphone.</p><p>Paul Joseph Watson, an editor at far-right conspiracy news site Infowars, tweeted an altered video of the altercation between Acosta and the White House intern that appeared to show Acosta striking the intern, which did not actually happen.

After locking herself in a pantry, she called the police.</p><p>An anti-fascist group called &quot;Smash Racism D.C.&quot; took credit for the protest and shared videos of the demonstration on Facebook and Twitter. The social media sites later took down the videos, and Twitter suspended the group&#x27;s Twitter account.</p><p>Protesters affiliated with the group have previously confronted politicians and public figures — including Carlson — in public spaces, but this is the first time that the group has staged a demonstration outside Carlson&#x27;s private home.</p><p>In one of the now-deleted videos posted by Smash Racism DC, a protester can be heard over a bullhorn saying, &quot;Tucker Carlson, we are outside your home.&quot; The protester goes on to accuse Carlson of &quot;promoting an ideology that has led to thousands of people dying at the hands of the police [and] trans women being murdered in the streets.&quot;</p><p>The protesters then break out into a chant: &quot;Tucker Carlson, we will fight! We know where you sleep at night!&quot;</p><p>The Post reports that during the demonstration, one of the protesters mentioned that she wanted to bring a &quot;pipe bomb&quot; to Carlson — a reference to Cesar Sayoc, the Trump supporter who sent pipe bombs to prominent critics of the president.</p><p>The Post also reports that Smash Racism DC tweeted out Carlson&#x27;s home address and published a Facebook post encouraging people to go to his home and confront him.</p><p>&quot;It wasn’t a protest,&quot; Carlson told the Post. &quot;It was a threat. They weren’t protesting anything specific that I had said. They weren’t asking me to change anything. They weren’t protesting a policy or advocating for legislation. ... They were threatening me and my family and telling me to leave my own neighborhood in the city that I grew up in.&quot;</p><p>Carlson said that he was especially concerned about the protester&#x27;s reference to pipe bombs.</p><p>&quot;If they’re talking about pipe bombs ... how do you live like that?&quot; he said. &quot;I probably won’t open another package sent to our house from now on.&quot;</p><p>Carlson also told the Post that one protester threw himself into the door, breaking it — an accusation that the protesters deny.</p><p>Alex Rubinstein, an independent journalist who contributes to RT and Sputnik, tweeted a photo of the door, which one of the protesters sent to him. He also tweeted a statement from the protesters defending the action against Carlson.</p></div></div>

The District of Columbia defines a hate crime as a crime &quot;that demonstrates an accused’s prejudice based on the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, personal appearance, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, family responsibility, homelessness, physical disability, matriculation, or political affiliation of a victim.”</p><p>According to the AP, the officers who responded the incident did not arrest any protesters but did confiscate a number of signs. An MPD police report on the incident does not mention any damage to Carlson&#x27;s door but does note that protesters vandalized his property by spray-painting an anarchist symbol on his driveway.</p><p>In a statement sent to multiple media organizations, MPD said that it had opened a criminal investigation into the incident:</p></div></div>

The campaign refused.</p><p>“We are not granting credentials to the Des Moines Register or any other leftist propaganda media outlet with no concern for reporting the truth,” the congressman’s son Jeff wrote in an email to the Register.</p><p>In a statement, Register executive editor Carol Hunter condemned the denial of access.</p><p>“The Des Moines Register will continue doing everything in its power to cover Rep. King fairly,” she said. “This decision is unfortunate because it not only shuts out the Des Moines Register reporter, but also the people of Iowa.”</p><p>Other reporters, like Chris Mathias of HuffPost, did not receive a response to an email request for press credentials. On the night of the election, Mathias went to King’s party to cover it.</p><p>“When Jeff King spotted me, he told me to leave,&quot; he told Freedom of the Press Foundation. &quot;When I asked why, he told me to check my email, and just minutes before I had just received an email saying that I wasn’t allowed in and that I should refer to the statement given to the Des Moines register about not letting leftist propaganda outlets in.&quot;</p><p>The reporters banned from covering the election night party had a history of reporting critically on King’s campaign. Mathias has written numerous pieces about King’s nationalist and racist messaging during his campaign, and has argued that King is a white supremacist.</p><p>The Weekly Standard&#x27;s Rubenstein has written about instances in which King has made apparently derogatory comments about Mexicans and Mexican Americans.</p><p>Rubenstein later reported that Jeff King had called the editor in chief at The Weekly Standard and demanded the piece be pulled. After the Standard went ahead and published it, Jeff King — who had previously told Rubenstein that he could cover the election-night event — pulled Rubenstein&#x27;s press credentials.</p><p>Rubenstein wrote in a Nov. 13 editorial for the New York Times that it was his critical reporting that got him banned from the party.</p><p>“Mr. King will insist that his opposition to the press is political — as in, the press is all left-wing propaganda,” he wrote. “In fact, it’s part of his calculated assault on truth and the ability to determine it. His idea of how the press is supposed to function would be right at home in the Gaza Strip, Iran or Turkey. Favorable coverage gets you open access. Dare to criticize and you are denied.”</p><p>HuffPost&#x27;s Mathias is concerned about the precedent of retaliatory denial of access that King is setting for other representatives. </p><p>“People like Steve King are picking up on Trump’s messaging about the press being the enemy of the people, and King has decided to part in it,&quot; he said. &quot;It’s a worrying trend if more representatives start to embrace the fake news smear.&quot;</p></div></div>","The congressman's son said that campaign views the Register as ""leftist propaganda""",None,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,"Adam Rubenstein, Chris Mathias, Tom Cullen, Tony Leys",,,,,,,,,Steve King

Four days later, he rescinded the order and unsealed the search warrant materials.</p><p>The search warrant was executed in January 2018 against Grant Robicheaux, a prominent surgeon suspected of sexually assaulting multiple women. Like most search warrants in California, it was initially filed under seal but was automatically unsealed and made available to the public shortly after it was carried out.</p><p>Eight months later, in September 2018, police arrested Robicheaux and his girlfriend, Cerissa Riley, and the Orange County district attorney Tony Rackauckas charged them with sexually assaulting two women. After the arrests were announced, a number of journalists found the January search warrant materials (which were now available to the public) and reported on their contents. In response, both prosecutors and Robicheaux’s defense team asked a judge to re-seal the search warrant materials, which he did.</p><p>The next month, as the Associated Press reported, Rackauckas announced that five more women had accused Robicheaux and Riley of sexual assault. At a court hearing on Oct. 17, Rackauckas’ office formally filed additional charges against Robicheaux and Riley, who pleaded not guilty.</p><p>According to the OC Register, outside the hearing, Orange County supervisor Todd Spitzer — who is challenging Rackauckas in the election for Orange County district attorney — held a press conference to criticize Rackauckas for taking so long to arrest Robicheaux and RIley. Speaking to a group of reporters, Spitzer said Rackauckas should have had Robicheaux and Riley arrested back in January 2018, right after the search warrant was executed. To prove his point, Spitzer and his assistant handed out copies of the January 2018 search warrant materials to reporters.</p><p>Rackauckas objected to Spitzer’s stunt, since the search warrant materials were supposed to be sealed from the public, and the district attorney’s office asked judge Jones do something about it. (Jones was not the judge who originally ordered the search warrant sealed, but he was the judge presiding over the hearing.)</p><p>Jones called reporters back into the courtroom and told them to return the copies of the search warrants that they had received. He then told them to remind their news organizations that the search warrant was sealed and they should not publish it.</p><p>The Orange County Register and the AP challenged judge Jones’ order, arguing that it amounted to an unconstitutional prior restraint on the press. On Oct. 21, Jones unsealed the search warrant, finding that it could not be re-sealed once it had already been made available to the public.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/judge-gavel-1461291406zfK.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,,,

The judge overseeing the trial said that Siegel had recorded part of the trial, in violation of the judge&#x27;s decorum order, and ordered him held in jail on a $100 bond.</p><p>On Oct. 2, Siegel was one of a number of journalists in attendance for the murder trial of Jason Van Dyke, a former Chicago police officer charged with murder in connection with the 2014 shooting of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager. Siegel, a freelance science journalist, was on assignment for Undark, an online magazine about science journalism funded through the Knight Science Journalism program at MIT. Siegel was working on a feature story about Laurence Miller, a police psychologist who often testifies as an expert witness for the defense in trials involving police use of force.</p><p>Shortly after Miller&#x27;s testimony began, judge Vincent Gaughan spotted Siegel recording the testimony and stopped the trial. After questioning Siegel, judge Gaughan ordered that he be held in &quot;direct criminal contempt&quot; for violating the judge&#x27;s earlier decorum order. Gaughan&#x27;s decorum order allowed a defined media pool to record the trial proceedings and then share the footage with other journalists, but prohibited individual journalists (like Siegel) from recording parts of the trial on their own. Siegel was removed from court and taken to jail.</p><p>Video recorded by ABC 7 (which was allowed to film the proceedings) shows Gaughan questioning Siegel.</p></div></div>

[…] The Times, therefore, respectfully requests that the Court vacate the Order immediately.”</p><p>Escobar’s attorney argued that because Sztraicher’s permission was granted verbally and not through written order, the photographs were obtained unlawfully.</p><p>Sztraicher denied this argument, acknowledging journalists had obtained prior verbal approval, and vacated his order.</p><p>“Defense attorneys often argue that publishing their client’s image before trial could improperly sway witnesses, … Once photographs have been taken legally, however, a judgeccccccjfk typically can’t bar news outlets from publishing them,” <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-escobar-photo-hearing-20180927-story.html"">The Times reported</a> following the hearing.</p><p>The AP also published on the successful free speech defense.</p><p>“The order should never have been issued in the first place,” David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, <a href=""https://apnews.com/564a8911b89d4f3d819aee6846c896bb"">told the AP</a>. “I’m glad the court saw the light of day.”</p><p>In a statement emailed to the Freedom of the Press Foundation about the decision, The Times’ Executive Editor Norman Pearlstine noted how the judge’s courtroom ruling put the news outlet in a difficult position.</p><p>“It is distressing that once again the Los Angeles Times needs to resort to litigation to preserve our rights under the 1st Amendment,” Pearlstine said.</p><p>Earlier in the year, The Times filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals to rescind a restraining order against publishing information made public in the criminal case of former narcotics detective John Balian.

Although some of the co-owners of the Atchafalaya River Basin property have given the company permission to build the pipeline, hundreds of others have refused to do so. Despite this, the company had already begun making alterations to the land, including removing trees and digging a ditch. It has also asked the state of Louisiana to use eminent domain to seize the land from the co-owners who object to the pipeline.</p><p>Savage told Freedom of the Press Foundation that one of the co-owners of the Atchafalaya Basin land who is resisting the pipeline had given her permission to be on the property.</p><p>“Some were actively resisting, and I had a letter from a landowner saying we were welcome to be on the property,&quot; she said. &quot;For people to visit the property, you only need permission from one landowner.”</p><p>Savage had previously been arrested for trespassing while reporting on the pipeline protests on Aug. 18. Once she was released on bail, she returned to the resistance camp at the Atchafalaya River Basin to continue covering the protest movement.</p><p>Savage said that on September 3 and 4, she witnessed law enforcement officers treated protesters badly.</p><p>“They chased them, tackled them, and allowed pipeline security employees to put their hands on protesters,&quot; she said. &quot;It was heavily violence and I got some pictures of law enforcement chasing them.”</p><p>She said that a few weeks later, on Sept. 17, she was riding in a vehicle that was pulled over in a different parish in Louisiana. The officers ran the ID&#x27;s of everyone in the car, but everything came back fine and they were allowed to proceed after receiving a citation.</p><p>The next day, sheriff&#x27;s deputies claimed that Savage had an outstanding warrant dating from Sept. 3.</p><p>Savage said that on September 18, she was tipped off by protesters to come to a particular part of the swamp, and when she pulled up in her boat to the ramp, she saw sheriff’s department officers present. As Savage began photographing the scene, the officers came to her and arrested her, allegedly on an outstanding warrant.</p><p>“They said they were arresting me for an outstanding warrant,” she said. “But I knew there was nothing out for me.”</p><p>Savage said that an individual who witnessed the arrest called the sheriff’s department to inquire why she was arrested and learned that there was no warrant out for her.</p><p>Savage was arrested under Louisiana&#x27;s newly-enacted state law against &quot;unauthorized entry of a critical infrastructure project.&quot; The Louisiana state law — which only went into effect on Aug. 1 — makes trespassing on a &quot;critical infrastructure project&quot; like an oil pipeline a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.</p><p>She had previously been arrested under the same law on Aug. 18.</p><p>Savage contrasted her treatment by the sheriff’s department to her previous arrest while covering the protest in August. Then, she said, the arrest wasn’t violent. But this time, she said the officers grabbed her roughly and pulled her hands back.</p><p>&quot;They really hurt me arms, shoulders, and wrists,&quot; she said. &quot;It was really unnecessary.&quot;</p><p>She said that the officers put her in the back of a police car and then drove her around for about an hour, which she found suspicious.</p><p>&quot;It’s a 20 minute drive to the station,&quot; she said. &quot;But they kept driving around through sugar cane fields, and I had no idea where he was taking me. I thought maybe it was intimidation because they didn’t actually have a warrant.&quot;</p><p>The St. Martin’s Sheriff Department did not respond to request for comment.</p><p>Savage said that, despite her two arrests, the local district attorney has not brought any criminal charges against her.</p><p>“I’m doubtful that they ever will,&quot; she said. &quot;It was a very clear intimidation tactic to stop me from covering the story.”</p><p>“I will go back,” she added. “I’m not going to let them intimidate me. It’s our job to hold these officials accountable.”</p></div></div>",Savage was also arrested while covering anti-pipeline protests in August 2018.,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/image.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,"<p>Freelance journalist Karen Savage is arrested by sheriff&#x27;s deputies while covering anti-pipeline protests in Louisiana, on September 18, 2018.</p>",arrested and released,not charged,None,None,True,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,Karen Savage,,"Bayou Bridge pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, pipeline, protest",,,,,,,

At the time, Savage was on assignment for The Appeal, a progressive news site focused on criminal justice issues.</p><p>Savage was embedded with a camp of protesters, known as water protectors, who were aiming to defend a piece of land in Louisiana’s Atchafalaya River Basin, a wetlands area co-owned by hundreds of people. Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, is trying to build its new Bayou Bridge oil pipeline through the area. Although some of the co-owners of the Atchafalaya Basin property have given the company permission to build the pipeline, hundreds of others have refused to do so. Despite this, the company had already begun making alterations to the land, including removing trees and digging a ditch. It has also asked the state of Louisiana to use eminent domain to seize the land from the co-owners who object to the pipeline.</p><p>Savage told Freedom of the Press Foundation that one of the co-owners of the Atchafalaya Basin land who is resisting the pipeline had given her permission to be on the property.</p><p>“Some were actively resisting, and I had a letter from a landowner saying we were welcome to be on the property,&quot; she said. &quot;For people to visit the property, you only need permission from one landowner.”</p><p>On Aug. 18, Savage was with three water protectors, taking pictures and reporting, when she was arrested by sheriff&#x27;s deputies from the nearby St. Martin Parish.</p><p>“I wasn’t even on the contested part of the land,” she said. “Sheriff’s deputies showed up and said I had to leave. I said I had permission to be there. I didn’t think I, or anyone else, would be arrested.”</p><p>She showed the officer a photograph of letter she had from a landowner, granting her permission to remain on the property. She said that she urged the officer to call the landowner, but he declined to do so. Officers then arrested her and the three water protectors who were with her.</p><p>Savage was one of the first people to be arrested under a newly-enacted Louisiana state law against &quot;unauthorized entry of a critical infrastructure project,&quot; which went into effect on Aug. 1. The new Louisiana state law makes trespassing on a &quot;critical infrastructure project&quot; like an oil pipeline a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. (Trespassing on land that is not a &quot;critical infrastructure project&quot; remains a misdemeanor.)</p><p>Although Savage was arrested under the law, the local district attorney has not yet brought any criminal charges against her.</p><p>After Savage was released on bail, she returned to the area to continue reporting on the protests against the Bayou Bridge pipeline.</p><p>“I bonded out, and kept reporting,” she said. “I wasn’t going to be intimidated.”</p><p>She later published a piece in The Appeal about her arrest and the way that Energy Transfer Partners employs off-duty law enforcement officers as a private security force, which works closely with uniformed St. Martin Parish sheriff&#x27;s deputies to arrest pipeline protesters.</p><p>The St. Martin’s Sheriff Department did not respond to request for comment.</p></div></div>",,None,None,,arrested and released,not charged,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,Karen Savage,,"Bayou Bridge pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, pipeline, protest",,,,,,,

Ruttle tried to photograph a group of approximately 20 white nationalists, who emerged from the Foggy Bottom metro station and were soon surrounded by Metropolitan Police Department officers. </p><p>“The scene was chaotic,” Ruttle told Freedom of the Press Foundation, describing the way that police officers on bicycles and motorcycles formed a “protective envelope” around the group.</p><p>Ruttle said that while he followed the marchers, he saw a police officer in front of him tip his bicycle over. Instinctively, Ruttle reached out to help the officer.</p><p>“He was having trouble getting back on,” Ruttle said. “To be honest, I’m not sure what was going through my mind, but if someone falls over, I try to reach for them, whether they’re a cop or activist or anyone else.”</p><p>Ruttle put his hand on the officer’s back and asked the officer if he was okay. That’s when he spotted another officer running toward him.</p><p>“For a split second I saw him running at me at what appeared to be full speed, and then he crashed into me,” Ruttle said. “Getting hit by a bulletproof vest is a hard service. I’ve been hit and shoved before, but that was like a football block. I saw black for a split second.”</p><p>“He got me in the chin real hard,” he added.</p><p>Although the impact rattled him, Ruttle remained on his feet. He said that he gave the officer who hit him some “choice words” and then explained that he was trying to assist the officer who had fallen off his bike. Ruttle said that the officer who hit him just walked backwards, pointed at him, and told him not to “do that again.” Then the officer disappeared.</p><p>At the time he was hit, Ruttle said, he was carrying three cameras and wearing his press credentials. </p><p>Ruttle said that he was able to continue his work documenting the rest of the rally, but his jaw remained sore sore for a week after the incident.</p><p>Ruttle has not been able to get anyone from the MPD to explain why an officer charged at him and hit him in the chin.</p><p>“I tried to engage with [the officer] later in the march, and he refused to make eye contact,” Ruttle said. “The only thing I can say is that he either thought I was trying to push his fellow officer to the ground, or he didn’t like that I had a hand on him.”</p><p>Ruttle said that he called the MPD&#x27;s public relations division in an attempt to understand what happened. Although the department took down his name and number, and promised to call him back, he said that he has not received any further communication from the MPD.</p><p>The MPD did not respond to a request for comment from Freedom of the Press Foundation.</p><p>Ruttle said the police officers at the Unite the Right II rally used aggressive tactics and seemed to have a “low tolerance threshold.”</p><p>“The cops put a group in the front, and they were being very aggressive,” he said. “You’d stop to take a picture, and backwalk, and it was never fast enough. I would try to take some pictures and they would push me, and as I’d walk further away to give them space, they&#x27;d shove me more. I got most of my shoves from the back. I was really impressed at how aggressive they were.”</p><p>Ruttle noted that freelance journalists in particular have to make difficult decisions about how far they are willing to for their reporting: “Is this day important enough for me as a freelance journalist to find myself in jail with no support? And have to deal with the legal system? Is it worth me risking getting hurt?”</p></div></div>",,None,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,law enforcement,no,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,Craig Ruttle,,"protest, white nationalist protest",,,,,,,

Police later said that the crash left two cars totaled and bystanders were barely able to extricate the crash victims from the cars before they burst into flame.</p><p>Weaver told Freedom of the Press Foundation that he arrived at the crash site just as the last ambulance was leaving to take victims to the hospital and maintenance workers were cleaning up the area.

It was one of those crystal clear moments where you know you’re doing a public service.”</p><p>The Sun Sentinel was part of a consortium of newspapers, Wallman said, working in tandem to acquire documents relating to the February 2018 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.</p><p>At a hearing on Aug. 3, 2018, Broward Circuit Court Judge Elizabeth Scherer had ordered the Broward school district to release a report produced by a consultant with nearly two-thirds of its content blacked out to protect the privacy rights of the gunman, Nicholas Cruz. The Sun Sentinel <a href=""https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-florida-school-shooting-school-board-contempt-20180807-story.html"">reported</a> that it was “a move that also concealed much about how the district mishandled Cruz’s education.”</p><p>Wallman told the Tracker that after the redacted report was released by the school district, a reader tipped them off that the document had been improperly censored: Copying and pasting the report into a separate file would reveal the full, uncensored text. Wallman and her fellow reporter, Paula McMahon, published an article detailing the full report that night.</p><p>The Broward school district’s chief lawyer, Barbara Myrick, notified Scherer of the publication of the uncensored report on Aug. 6 in a petition to invoke contempt hearings against the Sun Sentinel, as well as Wallman and McMahon individually.

MPD officers then arrested him and took him to an interrogation room, where Mendez said detectives pressured him to answer questions without an attorney present and to delete three of his photographs.</p><p>In an interview with Freedom of the Press Foundation, Mendez said he was preparing for the publication of a big piece on the local police department’s emergency response times. When Mendez’s editor asked him to get a photo to accompany the piece, he decided to stop by a police station near his house and take some pictures of MPD squad cars lined up in the parking lot.</p><p>Mendez drove into the parking lot and started taking photos of the MPD cars in the parking lot. When he spotted a police officer in civilian clothes with a badge around his neck, he said he waved and explained that he was a reporter taking photos for a story. The officer waved back as he walked to his car.</p><p>Mendez said he also noticed a uniformed MPD officer walking through the parking lot toward a police wagon. The uniformed officer did not wave back to Mendez.</p><p>After Mendez finished taking photos and left the lot, he saw that the police wagon was following him.</p><p>“I drove about two blocks away,” he told Freedom of the Press Foundation. “I noticed in my rearview that there was a paddy wagon. It followed me for about four more blocks and then pulled me over. He came up to my window and asked me what I was doing in the lot.”</p><p>When Mendez identified himself as a journalist and explained that he was taking photographs for a news story, the officer asked him if he had seen the “no trespassing” sign next the police station parking lot. Mendez said that he had not, but he would have obeyed it if he had seen it. According to Mendez, the officer took Mendez’s ID and returned to the police van to run it. In the meantime, Mendez texted his editor to let her know that he had been pulled over.</p><p>As Mendez waited for the officer to return his ID, an MPD squad car pulled up next to the police van. Once the officer from the squad car spoke with the officer from the police van, both officers approached Mendez and told him to exit his vehicle.</p><p>“They said, ‘well I’m going to have to give you a ticket for trespassing, and I’m going to need to cuff you and take you back to the station,’” Mendez recalled, adding that the officers insisted on placing him under arrest instead of just writing him a ticket on the spot.</p><p>“I just told them that I was a reporter and they could verify that, and I didn’t know that there was a no trespassing sign.”</p><p>At the police station, Mendez said he was asked about his medical and criminal history before being led into an interrogation room for further questioning.</p><p>Although Mendez said that he felt that he perhaps needed a lawyer, he said a detective made him feel that he was being overly defensive.</p><p>“They made it seem that if I had requested a lawyer, I wasn’t going to get to leave and they would probably transfer me to county jail,” he said.</p><p>The detective, according to Mendez, asked him about his family, including details about his parents’ ages and addresses, and accused him of defying an order.

Its reporter, who was unnamed, had asked Zuckerman to remove him from a mailing list multiple times.</p><p>“The specific threats were mentioned shooting a firearm through the window of the Walpole Times while people were there,” Walpole Police Chief John Carmichael <a href=""https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/07/09/woman-threat-shooting-walpole-times-journalist/"">told WBZ-TV CBS Boston</a> in July. “We figure that we had to give some credibility to it, especially in light of what just happened in Maryland, we took it seriously, the people at Walpole Times took it seriously.”</p><p>Zuckerman’s arrest came one week after Jarrod Ramos was charged with five counts of first-degree murder <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/man-upset-newspaper-coverage-shoots-and-kills-multiple-journalists-capital-gazette-newsroom/"">for the shooting deaths of Capital Gazette employees</a> in Annapolis, Maryland, on June 28.</p><p>Anne Brennan, Regional Director of News and Operations for GateHouse Media New England’s West Unit, explained her concern in a statement to the paper:</p><p>“The email contained what we believe to be a very serious threat of physical harm. The nature of the threat was very specific. Oftentimes as a journalist you receive threats, people get angry at you, but they’re not specific about what they’re going to do to you, sometimes they say they will cancel their subscription or something of that nature. This was a very specific threat of physical harm that not only put the journalist who received it in jeopardy, but the other people in that office as well, which is why we’re taking it very seriously.”</p><p>The same day of the Walpole Times incident, the Daily Hampshire Gazette filed trespassing charges against Zuckerman after she was asked to leave due to her behavior, <a href=""https://www.amherstbulletin.com/Amy-Zuckerman-held-until-dangerousness-hearing-Wednesday-18756684"">according to the Amherst Bulletin</a>.

On Aug. 6, Zuckerman was released, then arrested the following day after violating conditions of that release.</p><p>During a hearing at the Norfolk Superior Court on Aug. 13, the charges against Zuckerman <a href=""https://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/20180813/charges-reduced-against-woman-in-journalist-threat-case"">were downgraded</a> from making terroristic threats, a felony, to threatening to commit a crime, a misdemeanor.</p><p>In December, Zuckerman turned herself into Belchertown District Court after a warrant was issued for her arrest following a second probation violation.

At some point in the blur, either he or Officer Adam Paulsen, badge No. 08049, locked one or maybe two pair of handcuffs on my wrists, tightly, and pushed me toward a nearby police car by grabbing my arms hard enough – and with a painful upward thrust – that I told them to stop hurting me.

The meeting was not open to the public or press, so Lee had “staked out” the meeting, waiting outside of the room to speak with attendees as they entered or exited the meeting room. Around 10 p.m., he conducted a brief interview with Tommo Monthé, a Cameroonian diplomat who chairs the budget committee, and then headed over to a café area to type up his interview notes.</p><p>According to Lee, he was typing up his interview notes in the café when two UN security guards approached him and grabbed him, ordering him to leave the premises. Lee refused, insisting that he had the right to be in the building because he was a journalist covering a meeting. The altercation with the guards left Lee with a ripped shirt and an injured arm.</p><p>As Lee was being escorted outside, he spoke to Christian Saunders, an assistant secretary general. Lee livestreamed his conversation with Saunders and later uploaded portions of it to YouTube.</p></div></div>

Is that OK with you?”</p><p>“The budget hearings are the propriety of member states, and it’s a closed budget hearing,” Saunders says.</p><p>Lee refuses to leave, arguing that he has the right as a journalist to stand outside of the budget meeting and interview diplomats, while Saunders repeatedly tells Lee that he needs to obey the security guards’ orders to leave.</p><p>Lee, who appears to be very shaken up by the altercation, repeatedly refers to the security guards as “thugs” and criticizes them for using physical force against him.</p><p>“Seriously! I was sitting there typing,” he says to one of the security guards as they escort him out of the building. “You really have to push my neck, right? Something is wrong with you. You should be fired. If you were in the NYPD, you would be fired right now because I’m not resisting. You had no right to touch my computer. You had no right to tear my shirt!”</p><p>On July 4, the day after Lee was removed from the building, he filed a police report against the UN for assault.</p><p>On July 5, the UN suspended his press credentials, pending the conclusion of an investigation into his behavior. Without UN press credentials, Lee was not allowed entrance into the UN headquarters building. Instead, he had to cover the UN from a bus stop across the street.</p><p>Although the investigation initially focused on the July 3 incident, but it soon expanded into a more general review of Lee’s behavior and professionalism. The review considered numerous complaints made about Lee’s behavior by UN member states, UN staff, and Lee’s fellow UN correspondents. Lee was not given any opportunity to respond to any of the complaints against him.</p><p>On Aug. 17, the UN notified Lee in a letter that it had concluded its review and decided to withdraw his press accreditation.</p></div></div>

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Lee believes that the UN leadership is retaliating against him because he has reported on their apparent conflicts of interest and corruption. The UN, for its part, says that it objects only to Lee’s behavior, not his reporting.</p><p>“Just like the White House, access is not a right, it’s a privilege,” UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told the Columbia Journalism Review. “None of this is happening now because of what he writes. … He creates an atmosphere of incivility within our working environment.”</p><p>But it is difficult to separate Lee’s behavior from his reporting. He is an aggressive reporter, in every sense of the word. He is dedicated to exposing the corruption and conflicts of interest that he believes permeate the UN, and he has little patience for those who refuse to talk to him. Although his breathless posts on Inner City Press and his commentary-filled livestreams may often seem hyperbolic and conspiratorial, Lee has done important investigative journalism on some of the unsavory influence-peddling that underlies diplomacy at the UN.</p><p>In particular, he has reported on the UN’s close relationships with unsavory regimes in places like Cameroon, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Recently, Lee has reported that the UN leadership has soft-pedaled criticism of Cameroon’s human rights abuses at the same time that it has tried to win budgetary concessions from the Cameroonian diplomat who chairs the UN budget committee. That is the reason that he was covering the budget meeting late at night on July 3, which led to him being forcibly escorted out of the building.</p><p>Lee has suggested that the UN roughed him up and expelled him from the UN building on July 3 as part of a conspiracy to stop him from reporting on the UN’s relationship with Cameroon. It’s more likely that Lee was ordered to leave the building because it was after 7 p.m. and he was a non-resident correspondent. Still, whether intentional or not, the UN&#x27;s actions have had the effect of making it more difficult for Lee to report on conflicts of interest at the UN.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/matthewlee-expel.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,private security,yes,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,Matt Lee,,,,,,,,,United Nations

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Jarrod Ramos, the suspect in the shooting, had threatened and harassed Capital Gazette staffers for years, according to the Sun.</p><p>It began in July 2011, when Capital columnist Eric Hartley wrote about how Ramos was charged with harassment after stalking and threatening a high school classmate online. In response to Hartley&#x27;s column, Ramos waged a one-man war against him and the paper. (Hartley has since left The Capital for The Virginian-Pilot, and Marquardt has retired.)</p><p>In July 2012, he filed a defamation lawsuit against Hartley, Capital Gazette Communications, and The Capital editor and publisher Tom Marquardt. Ramos represented himself in the suit, which was filed in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. At a March 2013 court hearing, a judge dismissed Ramos&#x27; complaint with prejudice and tried to explain to Ramos why the article was not defamatory:</p></div></div>

	<div class=""rich-text""><p>The appellant is pro se. A lawyer would almost certainly have told him not to proceed with this case. It reveals a fundamental failure to understand what defamation law is and, more particularly, what defamation law is not. The appellant is aggrieved because the newspaper story about his guilty plea assumed that he was guilty and that the guilty plea was, therefore, properly accepted. He is aggrieved because the story was sympathetic toward the harassment victim and was not equally understanding of the harassment perpetrator. The appellant wanted equal coverage of his side of the story. He wanted a chance to put the victim in a bad light, in order to justify and explain why he did what he did. That, however, is not the function of defamation law.</p><p>The appellant was charged with a criminal act. The appellant perpetrated a criminal act. The appellant plead guilty to having perpetrated a criminal act. The appellant was punished for his criminal act. He is not entitled to equal sympathy with his victim and may not blithely dismiss her as a &quot;bipolar drunkard.&quot; He does not appear to have learned his lesson.</p></div>

Robles fought the subpoenas, but the New York Court of Appeals — the highest court in the state — upheld the subpoenas on a technicality in a ruling on June 27, 2018. </p><p>If Robles refuses to comply with the subpoena, she could be held in contempt of court and put in jail.</p><p>In October 2013, Robles conducted a jailhouse interview with Conrado Juarez, who had been charged with the murder of “Baby Hope,” a four year old found dead in a picnic cooler in 1991. Although Juarez had confessed to the murder to police, he told Robles that police had coerced him into confessing. The day after the interview, the Times reported that Juarez claimed that his confession to police had been coerced.</p><p>In early 2016, Robles was subpoenaed to testify about her interview with Juarez and to hand over her reporter’s notes from the interview. Robles was subpoenaed to testify at a pre-trial hearing to determine admissibility of Juarez’s statements to law enforcement. </p><p>Robles moved to quash the subpoenas.</p><p>According to the New York State Constitution, a reporter can only be compelled to disclose non-confidential information if it is “critical or necessary” to the case and not available from any other source.</p><p>On April 13, 2016, the court quashed the subpoena, ruling that Robles’ testimony was not “critical or necessary” to the pretrial hearing because the prosecution already had a videotape of Juarez’s confession and access to the police and prosecutor that obtained it. The court also noted that compelling Robles’ testimony would open the door to lines of questioning beyond published material during cross examination.</p><p>After the pretrial hearing, the prosecution tried to subpoena Robles to testify during Juarez’s criminal trial. Robles again moved to quash the subpoenas, but this time, the trial court ruled against her. In August 2016, the trial court formally upheld the subpoenas, ruling that her testimony was “critical or necessary” to the case that the prosecution wanted to make about Juarez’s confession during the trial.</p><p>Robles immediately appealed the trial court’s decision. In October 2016, the First Department appeals court reversed the trial court’s decision, finding that the prosecution had not shown that Robles’ testimony was so “critical or necessary” that it could override her reporter’s privilege not to testify about her sources.</p><p>The prosecution then asked the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court in New York state, to review the First Department appeals court’s decision, and the New York Court of Appeals agreed to do so. </p><p>The prosecution wanted the New York Court of Appeals to find that Robles’ testimony was in fact “critical or necessary” to the case and the First Department appeals court was wrong to reverse the trial court’s original decision forcing Robles to testify. Robles’ attorneys wanted the New York Court of Appeals to uphold the First Department appeals court’s decision and ensure that journalists in New York state cannot be compelled to testify in court about her conversations with sources. </p><p>“Ms. Roles has testified that most sources in jail would not speak with her if they came to believe ‘that the prosecution could successfully compel [her] to testify’ about their conversations,” Robles’ legal team wrote in a brief to the New York Court of Appeals. “Permitting prosecutors to enforce subpoenas like the one in this case would ‘fundamentally diminish’ Ms. Robles’s ‘practical ability to gather the news…’ and would in turn diminish the public’s knowledge about claims of mistreatment by indigent individuals caught up in the criminal justice system.”</p><p>In the end, the New York Court of Appeals did not rule on whether or not Robles’ testimony was necessary to the case. Instead, in a controversial 4-3 decision, the Court of Appeals ruled that Robles was not technically allowed to appeal the trial court’s original decision, so the First Department appeals court’s ruling was completely moot.</p><p>The New York Court of Appeals did not actually say that the trial court’s decision to uphold the subpoenas was correct, just that Robles was not allowed to appeal it.</p><p>But it hardly matters to Robles. Since she’s not allowed to appeal the trial court’s decision to uphold the subpoenas ordering to testify, that decision stands.</p><p>If she refuses to testify, the trial court could find her in contempt of court and order her jailed until she agrees to testify.</p><p>The Reporters Committee for Freedom of Press (a partner organization of the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker) criticized the Court of Appeals decision.</p><p>“The protections of a shield law are meaningless unless a reporter can appeal an erroneous trial court ruling,” RCFP executive director Bruce Brown said in a statement. “Today’s decision leaves important substantive protections for journalists under New York law without the means to enforce them. A reporter should not have to risk going to jail for contempt in order to trigger appellate review of her rights.”</p></div></div>",,None,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,journalist communications or work product,['UPHELD'],None,None,None,None,None,None,Frances Robles,,,,,,,,,

Raftery told Freedom of the Press Foundation that Kruze called her shortly after the incident.</p><p>“When Paul called me, his voice was trembling and he was obviously terrified,” she said. “I was worried about his safety and my own, especially since Paul said Kalasho told him, with the dog snarling lunging toward him, ‘I’m going to take you down and that bitch, Miriam Raftery.'”</p><p>On June 24, the day after the parking lot incident, Kalasho published a Facebook post about Kruze, whom he described as a “deranged psychopath” and “lunatic” who was stalking him.</p><p>“I did research and found that this so called journalist made a Youtube channel whereby most all of his videos are about me,” Kalasho wrote in the post, which was later deleted. “He even posted a video of me training my dog, and other montage videos of me speaking ranging different dates. This infatuation he has with me is creepy to say the least.”</p><p>Kalasho wrote that he had contacted the police and planned to seek a restraining order against the journalist.</p><p>A number of Kalasho’s supporters commented on the Facebook post, expressing concern for the councilman’s safety. Some encouraged Kalasho to use violence against Kruze.</p><p>“You should get your CCW [concealed carry license],” one commenter wrote.</p><p>“Once you become a public figure, you lose most of your rights,” Kalasho replied. “Trust me, had I had a CCW, I would have been on CNN today doing interviews from behind bars.”</p><p>Another supporter published a photo of a gun, accompanied by the text, “I would much rather go my grave never needing my gun, than go there wishing I had it.” Kalasho replied, “#Truth.”</p><p>Kruze said that it was scary to see Kalasho encouraging supporters’ violent threats against him.</p><p>“He just kept on inciting these different followers of his, and then the people started posting,” Kruze said. “There were people saying you should go after this guy. Then they started posting pictures of guns, and then it ended up with another guy who was an optometrist in Ramona, California, suggesting that a .357 caliber bullet be used on me,” Kruze said. “I’ll tell you that finally, that particular post, and the whole Facebook post, it finally hit me. It hit me… All the sudden this is what people talk about for real, and that is damn scary.”</p><p>On July 10, Kalasho went after Kruze again, this time in a Facebook video.</p><p>In the video, Kalasho says that he threatened Kruze with his dog because he thought Kruze might be carrying a weapon.</p><p>“Looking at this person that was approaching my wife and I, like, I don’t know him from Adam,” Kalasho says in the video. “I don’t know if he had a knife, or a gun or anything on him. And every cue and everything that he did lead me to believe that he was going to inflict harm to me or my family. So I used my dog. And anybody listening, watching this just play it through, what’s the alternative? The alternative is having my wife hurt? No, I’d rather my dog maul him, like literally.”</p><p>On July 13, the San Diego Society of Professional Journalists issued a statement, defending the rights of journalists and calling on the El Cajon Police Department to fully investigate the attack:</p></div></div>

On June 11, he was in Jefferson City, documenting a civil disobedience action in which a number of protesters planned to sit down in the middle of the street and be arrested.</p><p>Nigro is a multimedia journalist who takes still photographs and livestreams events. He’s mounted his iPhone on top of his DSLR camera, a Canon 5D Mark III, so that he can take high-quality still photos while at the same time streaming to the public exactly what he sees in real-time. On June 11, he was wearing press credentials — both a New York City government press card and a Truthdig press pass — that clearly identified him as a journalist.</p><p>Nigro believes that his arrest was unjustified and that the Jefferson City police knew that he was a journalist.</p><p>“When people are performing acts of civil disobedience, I have every right as a journalist to document it, as long as I am not in the police officers’ way, which I was not,” he said.</p><p>Nigro’s June 11 livestream shows demonstrators marching toward the Missouri state capitol building and then the Missouri Chamber of Commerce. After arriving at the Chamber of Commerce building, a few dozen protesters — all wearing gold armbands, a sign that they plan to perform an act of civil disobedience and face arrest — walk onto East Capitol Avenue, link arms, and sit down. </p></div></div>

The arresting officer hands Nigro’s equipment — camera, phone, and backpack — over to other officers and tells them, “it’s evidence.” The livestream continues for a few minutes after Nigro is arrested, as police search his backpack.</p><p>Nigro said that he was kept in the police van for about an hour and then taken to the police precinct. Nigro said that he was concerned for his safety while riding in the van, since officers never strapped him into his seat.</p><p>“At one point, they started to move the van and I was not tied in,” he said. “The guy leaned back and said, ‘Are you OK?’ I said, ‘Yeah but I’m not strapped in.’ He said, ‘We’re not going anywhere, just moving backward.’ About an hour later, they took me to the precinct but never strapped me in.”</p><p>When he got to the precinct, he said, he was processed and put in a holding cell for about half an hour, before being released on a $545 bail. </p><p>All of Nigro’s equipment — including his iPhone, Canon 5D Mark III camera, two camera lenses (a 24–70mm standard lens and a Sony A7ii 70–200mm zoom lens), and notebook — was returned to him when he was released.

On June 8, the indictment was unsealed.</p><p>According to the unsealed indictment, FBI agents interviewed Wolfe in December 2017 and asked him whether he had been in contact with any reporters, whether he had personal or professional relationships with any reporters, and whether he had given information (classified or unclassified) to reporters that he was not authorized to disclose. According to the indictment, Wolfe falsely told the FBI that he had not.</p><p>The indictment states that he specifically denied knowing Ali Watkins, a national security reporter who currently works at The New York Times and previously worked at BuzzFeed and Politico. When FBI agents later showed Wolfe a photo of him with Watkins, he admitted that he had been in a personal relationship with her for three years, but said that he had not disclosed any confidential information to her.</p><p>According to the Times, the Department of Justice informed Watkins in February that it had seized years’ worth of her phone and email records as part of its investigation into the leaks. Although the Justice Department did not obtain the content of her phone calls, texts, and emails, it did obtain all of the metadata — which reveals who she was in contact with and when she was in contact with them. The Justice Department cited some of those records in the indictment to establish that Wolfe and Watkins spoke to one another shortly before and after she published major stories.</p><p>So far, Wolfe has not been charged with disclosing classified information to Watkins or any other reporters.</p><p>The FBI initially interviewed Wolfe as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information to reporters, but the grand jury only indicted him on charges of lying to FBI agents. It did not indict him on any charges of disclosing classified information. In a press release announcing the indictment, the Department of Justice only alleged that Wolfe had leaked “sensitive and confidential” information, not classified information. Watkins told the Times that Wolfe was not a source of classified information for her.</p><p>Wolfe is the third person since Trump took office to be prosecuted in connection with a leak investigation. In June 2017, NSA contractor Reality Winner was accused of sending news organization The Intercept a classified document about the NSA’s investigation into Russian hacking attempts. In March 2018, former FBI agent Terry Albury was accused of sending The Intercept classified documents that instruct FBI agents on how to cultivate informants and surveil journalists.</p><p>Both Winner and Albury were charged under the Espionage Act — a century-old law originally targeted at foreign spies that has more been used to prosecute people who give classified information to journalists. Albury took a plea deal, while Winner has continued to fight her case, while repeatedly being denied bail.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/james_wolfe.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,James Wolfe,,,,,,,"Ali Watkins, The New York Times","Ali Watkins, The New York Times",

Authorities have not said publicly whether they believe that the murder is connected to Stoner’s work.</p><p>WGN reports that Stoner was last seen alive around 1 a.m. in the early hours of May 30th, when he left a rap concert at Refuge, a club in downtown Chicago. Around 1:30 a.m., he was driving his Jeep down Clark Street in the South Loop neighborhood in Chicago when unknown assailants in a second vehicle pulled alongside him and opened fire. </p><p>The bullets struck Stoner in the head and neck, causing him to drive onto a curb and crash into a light pole. He was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in critical condition, but was declared dead at 4:20 a.m., according to a log from the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office.</p><p>Videos recorded by bystanders immediately after the shooting show three cars — Stoner’s Jeep, a wrecked Chevy Caprice, and a third car — and a group of people running to the third car. One of the persons in the video can be heard shouting, “Let’s go!” </p><p>Stoner, who grew up in a poor suburb of Chicago, ran a Youtube channel called “ZackTV1,” which had over 170,000 followers at the time of his death. On his channel, he posted exclusive interviews with underground hip hop artists and members of local gangs. Though some of his videos were controversial — a few mentioned conspiracy theories and others featured young men throwing gang signs and threatening their rivals  — his friends and associates said that he always tried to remain neutral in gang disputes and was willing to interview anyone.</p><p>“He wasn’t in any gangs and he would and could literally go into any hood with his camera and get nothing but love,” music studio owner JP Lee told the Chicago Sun-Times.</p><p>“I’m hearing stories like they may have been mad at him because he did interviews with certain rappers,&quot; Stoner’s friend Phor Robinson told WGN. &quot;But that’s not his fault for him doing his job. I don’t know why anyone would attack Zack and shoot him. He’s not that type. He shows love to everybody in Chicago.”</p><p>Morgan Elise Johnson, co-founder and creative director of the Chicago-based publication The Triibe, met with Stoner and his business partner Tony Woods a month before Stoner’s death to discuss a potential partnership.</p><p>“His voice was so powerful in the hood, and I don’t know if that power had something to do with his death,” Johnson told the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p><p>Stoner received threats related to his reporting, particularly his coverage of the death of Kenneka Jenkins, a teenage girl. On Sept. 10, 2017, Jenkins was found dead in a walk-in freezer at the Crowne Plaza O’Hare Hotel, where she had attended a party the night before. Although the death was ultimately ruled an accident, it sparked a massive social media frenzy and numerous conspiracy theories.</p><p>Stoner interviewed some of Jenkins’ friends who were with her the night that she died, but initially did not post the videos. In Oct. 2017, he received a threatening phone call from an anonymous woman, who warned him to “leave the case alone… leave it alone for your safety.” At the time, Stoner said that he would not post interviews related to the case because his house had been broken into, his camera gear stolen, and he was receiving threatening phone calls and emails. But in late November, he finally published the videos.</p><p>In April 2018, freelance journalist Charles Preston profiled Stoner for the Chicago Defender.</p><p>“Stoner documents what others neglect and repeatedly interviews personalities who many had hoped would never grace a camera,” Preston wrote. “His videos are not fluffy, glitzy, and sentimental documentary shorts; on the contrary, they are more like visceral punches to the gut that can leave you either inspired for change or disturbed by reality. He has given the city’s most controversial artists their first on-camera interviews and covered neighborhoods where news reporters keep their news trucks running.”</p><p>&quot;I wanted to show the world what the other side of Chicago looks like…our culture — the way we dress, what we eat, how we talk, how we walk,” Stoner told Preston.</p><p>&quot;A lot of people respect what I do,&quot; he added. &quot;I&#x27;m the &#x27;Hood CNN.&#x27;&quot;</p><p>The profile also highlighted Stoner’s involvement in community service work.</p><p>“People don’t see what he does behind the scenes,” Woods, Stoner’s mentor, told the Defender. “There have been many occasions where a guy will call Zack on his way ride on his opps (Chicago slang for enemies) and Zack would talk him down. The brother has a jail phone. He sends money to incarcerated brothers and takes care of their families. People don’t get to see that side of it. They assume because he’s interviewing [members of rival gangs] the GD&#x27;s or BD&#x27;s that he’s fanning the flames and that’s not the case.”</p><p>Shortly after Stoner’s death was confirmed, Preston said on Twitter that Stoner had discussed the possibility of working with the Chicago Defender to create a documentary series about violence in Chicago.</p></div></div>

He landed at the airport at around 8:45 a.m. He said that he presented a CBP agent with his Tunisian passport, bearing a B1 U.S. visa, and was directed to secondary screening. The officer, whom Krichen told CPJ was consistently polite and kind to him, then led him through a police area, fingerprinted him, and accompanied him to the baggage claim area. While waiting for the bags, the officer flipped through his passport —which is three, thoroughly stamped passports glued together — and asked him why he travels so much. He simply responded, “I am a journalist.”</p><p>Once Krichen retrieved his luggage, the officer ushered him into an interview room and began asking him for personal details, including his wife’s name and birthdate, her workplace, her nationality, their full home address, and his contact information. Krichen said that the officer also asked about his work — where he has traveled and why, the names of the programs he hosts, the topics they cover, and who he has interviewed. After these “typical” background questions, Krichen said, the officer’s questions turned to terrorism, “which he seemed obsessed with.”</p><p>The officer asked if he’d had any relationship with an individual involved with terrorism, interviewed someone accused of terrorism, or had any relationship with someone suspected of terrorism. Krichen said that he pulled out his phone and unlocked it to double check the name of a former colleague — Sami al-Hadj — who had been arrested in Afghanistan and detained in Guantanamo Bay for six years. Krichen had interviewed al-Hadj about his time in the prison. </p><p>After asking once again if Krichen had any relationships with individuals suspected of or involved in terrorism, the officer and  Krichen went through his suitcases, piece by piece. After that, Krichen said, the officer asked to see Krichen's unlocked cell phone. The officer asked Krichen if he uses his full name on Facebook and Twitter (he does) and then led him out to a waiting room while the officer walked to a nearby counter to examine the phone. Krichen said that he was able to observe the officer swiping through his phone for five to seven minutes, but he couldn’t see what the officer was browsing through.</p><p>Afterward, the officer made a call — Krichen told CPJ it appeared that he was calling a supervisor — and spoke on the phone for approximately ten minutes, all the while flipping through the notes he had taken during his interview of Krichen. Immediately after hanging up the phone, the officer stamped Krichen’s passport, returned his phone, and told him he was free to leave. Krichen said that the entire incident took about an hour.</p><p>Krichen told CPJ he considered asking why he had been stopped in the first place, as the officer never offered any explanation or apology for stopping him, but he decided against it. He said that he assumes he was selected at random, in part because he doesn’t want “to play the victim or the martyr.”</p><p>“I’m just glad I was only traveling with my phone and not my laptop,” Krichen said, “because they might’ve tried to search that too.”</p><p>According to a CBP directive released in January 2018, travelers are “obligated” to turn over their unlocked and unencrypted devices to CBP agents, who may perform “basic” searches of electronic devices without cause. The CBP directive states that “advanced,” or forensic, searches require “reasonable suspicion of activity in violation of the laws enforced or administered by CBP,” but basic lawful searches using less . The Supreme Court has upheld the so-called “border search exception” to the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, though it has not specifically ruled on the consitutionality of searches conducted in accordance with CBP's January 2018 directive.</p></div></div>",,None,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,returned in full,False,law enforcement,John F.

On May 22, the AP confirmed that it had received the subpoena and planned to fight it.</p><p>The subpoena is part of a civil suit that Broidy filed in federal court in California against the government of Qatar. Broidy has accused Qatar of hacking his emails and then working with a P.R. firm to leak copies of the emails to journalists at the AP and other news organizations.</p><p>On May 21, the AP published a deeply-reported investigation into Elliott's work with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, two nations that have been locked in an escalating diplomatic feud with Qatar for more than a year. </p><p>The AP investigation, which was ""based on interviews with more than two dozen people and hundreds of pages of leaked emails between"" Broidy and a business partner, reported that Broidy had lobbied Trump and other administration to adopt the kind of anti-Qatar foreign policy favored by the UAE and Saudi Arabia, and was then rewarded by the UAE government with a lucrative consulting contract.</p><p>In the same story, the AP reported that beginning in February 2018, a number of news organizations started to receive ""anonymously leaked batches of Broidy’s emails and documents that had apparently been hacked."" And a lawyer for Broidy told the AP that its reporting ""is based on fraudulent and fabricated documents obtained from entities with a known agenda to harm Mr. Broidy.""</p><p>In the past, both Qatar and the UAE have accused one another of hacking the other, so it's not surprising that Broidy believes that Qatar is connected to the hack and leak of his emails.</p><p>His goal seems to be to use the subpoena to force the AP to turn over documents that implicate Qatar in the leak of his emails, which he can then use as evidence in his civil suit against the Qatari government.</p><p>An AP spokeswoman told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that the news outlet plans to fight the subpoena. The AP is expected to invoke reporter's privilege, which protects journalists and news organizations from being forced by the government to reveal information about its confidential sources.</p><p>Lee Wolosky — the attorney at Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner who drew up the subpoena on Broidy's behalf — did not respond to a request for comment.

	<div class=""rich-text""><p>For more than a year, Ms. Schmidt, a reporter for the Arizona Daily Star, has been reporting on and covering the relationship between Craig Carter, a former University of Arizona assistant track coach, and a female-student athlete, Baillie Jean Gibson, including allegations that Mr. Carter assaulted Ms. Gibson. Mr. Carter was ultimately criminally convicted of assaulting Ms. Gibson and pled guilty to other felony counts arising out of his conduct in the relationship. Now, in this related civil suit, the Carters, through their attorney, seek to uncover any communications that Ms. Schmidt and any “other person or entity currently or formerly affiliated in any way with the Arizona Daily Star” [see attached subpoena to Arizona Daily Star, Ex. A, ¶ 1] may have had with Ms. Gibson and Ms. Gibson’s lawyers in the course of reporting for the Arizona Daily Star. Specifically, the Subpoenas demand that Ms. Schmidt, the Arizona Daily Star and anyone else “affiliated in any way” with the Star produce all “documents and communications” between: (1) themselves and certain named law firms and attorneys who have purportedly worked for Ms. Gibson; and (2) themselves and Ms. Gibson.</p><p>The Carters, however, are not entitled to these materials. Instead, the Subpoenas must be quashed because the affidavits accompanying them do not satisfy the Media Subpoena Law, A.R.S. § 12-2214, which “protect[s] members of the media from burdensome subpoenas and broad discovery ‘fishing expeditions’ that would,” as here, “interfere with the ongoing business of gathering and reporting news to the public.” <i>Matera v.

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>During the presidential campaign, though, the Trump administration routinely denied press credentials to reporters it did not like. But the White House is not supposed to have any role in the process of credentialing media organizations, which has traditionally been the domain of the White House Correspondents Association, an independent group of journalists who cover the White House. Since assuming office, Trump has not moved to revoke any journalist&#x27;s White House press credentials, though his former press secretary once excluded certain news organizations from an informal briefing.</p><p>The president&#x27;s May 9 tweet references a controversial analysis conducted by the Media Research Center, a conservative media watchdog, which attempts to gauge the sentiment (positive or negative) of news coverage of Trump on major networks&#x27; evening newscasts. According to the MRC&#x27;s most recent analysis, 90% of the coverage of Trump on ABC, CBS, and NBC evening newscasts between Jan. 1 and April 30, 2018, was negative. That&#x27;s consistent with MRC analyses from 2017, which found that 91% of coverage of Trump on the evening newscasts was negative. </p><p>Although the methodology of the MRC analysis has been criticized, the Fox News morning show “Fox &amp; Friends” cited its results authoritatively on the morning of May 9, shortly before the president’s tweet.</p><p>In his tweet, the president stated that 91% of the news coverage was &quot;negative (Fake).&quot; But the MRC did not try to analyze whether the news coverage was &quot;fake&quot; (i.e. inaccurate), just whether it portrayed Trump in a positive or negative light. The president seems to believe that all negative news coverage of him is &quot;fake,&quot; regardless of whether or not the news coverage is accurate.</p><p>Designating negative coverage as “fake news” and threatening to revoke network’s credentials in order to discourage such reporting has become a marked tendency for this administration.</p><p>Trump frequently criticizes journalists&#x27; reporting on his administration, denouncing it as &quot;fake news&quot; even when it is true. According to the Trump Twitter Archive, he has tweeted the phrase “fake news” at least 40 times this year.</p><p>In a statement, White House Correspondents Association president Margaret Talev denounced Trump’s comments.</p><p>“Some may excuse the president’s inflammatory rhetoric about the media, but just because the president does not like news coverage does not make it fake,” she said. “A free press must be able to report on the good, the bad, the momentous and the mundane, without fear or favor. And a president preventing a free and independent press from covering the workings of our republic would be an unconscionable assault on the First Amendment.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2018-05-11_at_10.53.3.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,"Donald Trump, Trump administration, tweet",,,,,,,

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>These legal theories, if adopted by the courts, would have broad and dangerous implications for all types of reporters who cover election campaigns.</p><p>After WikiLeaks published documents about the DNC, countless media outlets — including mainstream news publications such as The New York Times and The Washington Post — reported on the internal DNC communications and even republished some of the documents. Under the DNC’s theory of the case, the Times and Post could theoretically also be liable for wiretapping, for &quot;knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications” with the DNC.</p><p>(In the 2001 case Bartnicki v. Vopper, the Supreme Court ruled that news organizations have a First Amendment right to publish information in the public interest even if they knew the source of the information violated the law to obtain it.)</p><p>Separate from the case of WikiLeaks, newspapers often report on and publish internal documents and emails from all sorts of electoral campaigns. For example, the Washington Post published internal campaign document from the Trump administration in April 2016. Some of these stories may come from hacked materials, but most come from sources inside a campaign who hand documents over to news organizations without official authorization.</p><p>Under the theory of the DNC’s lawsuit, news organizations that publish internal campaign documents could potentially be sued — or even prosecuted by the government — for economic espionage or theft of trade secrets, raising serious press freedom concerns.</p><p>It&#x27;s not just campaign reporters who are at risk. If the court found WikiLeaks liable for “theft of trade secrets” just for publishing internal information about the DNC, then corporations of all stripes could arguably use the same arguments to silence journalists like John Carreyrou, the Wall Street Journal reporter who exposed serious misconduct and fraud at the blood-testing company Theranos.</p><p>In a comment on Twitter responding to the lawsuit, WikiLeaks said that its publication of the DNC documents was protected by the First Amendment:</p></div></div>

Another woman in the video, Jennifer Curtiss, a trustee with the Village of Fox River Grove, asks the clerk, “Karen, do you have the authority to be going through this stuff?” prompting Lukasik to respond, “I can do whatever I want.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>The video was filmed on a Nest camera hidden in a bookshelf in the Township Supervisor’s Office and shared via a flash drive mailed anonymously to the Edgar County Watchdogs, a blog that posts responses to Freedom of Information Act requests filed with various government bodies around the state of Illinois.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The attorney for Algonquin Township, James Kelly, claimed the video violated “court orders” and “certain privacy rights” in his letter to YouTube dated March 16, 2018. “The video was unlawfully removed from the Township and turned over to a third party. This video may violate the individuals [sic] privacy rights,” Kelly wrote. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Kelly provided YouTube with two protective orders a judge signed in Gasser v. Lukasik, a separate lawsuit involving the township clerk, in June and November of 2017. The court orders appointed a receiver to recover video camera footage and copy machine hard drives from the Algonquin Township building, and barred distribution of that material beyond the attorneys and parties to the lawsuit. </p><p></p><p>“This is clearly attempted censorship,” John Kraft, one of the co-founders of Edgar County Watchdogs, wrote in a <a href=""https://edgarcountywatchdogs.com/2019/01/algonquin-township-attempts-censoring-watchdogs/"">blog post</a>. “We were not party to the lawsuit that dealt with sealing these documents,” Kraft told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. Kraft also maintained that the order did not prevent the video footage from being disclosed under Illinois public records laws. </p><p>The video is still on YouTube as of press time. </p><p>""When the media lawfully obtains information that is truthful and newsworthy, it has the right to publish that information absent extraordinary circumstances,” Sarah Matthews, a staff attorney with the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. (Full disclosure: Matthews is on the steering committee for the Tracker.) </p><p>Kraft said he found out about the letter sent to YouTube demanding the removal of the video via a tip and then by reviewing Kelly's legal bills submitted to the township. Those bills also indicated YouTube had sent a letter in response to Kelly’s takedown request. Kraft said he submitted public records requests for YouTube’s response to Kelly but has not received it. </p><p>Edgar County Watchdogs is currently suing Algonquin Township for not producing documents in response to 16 different FOIA requests. </p><p>Multiple requests for comment—and a request to review YouTube’s reply to the takedown request—sent to Kelly and Lukasik were not answered. <br/></p><p><i>— The<a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</a> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

The subpoena was quashed on March 20.</p><p>Baars told Freedom of the Press Foundation that a deputy served her the subpoena on March 16, while she was at the Charlottesville General District Court to cover a different trial. The subpoena ordered her to appear in court on March 20, the day of Kessler’s perjury trial.</p><p>Kessler, who co-organized the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, was charged with one count of perjury for allegedly lying on a criminal complaint that he had filed with the magistrate at the Albemarle Charlottesville Regional Jail. In the complaint, Kessler said he was assaulted by Jay Taylor. Video evidence later showed that Taylor did not assault Kessler.</p><p>Baars said that James West, her attorney, filed a motion to quash the subpoena just minutes before the clerk’s office closed on March 19. Judge Cheryl Higgins granted the motion following morning on March 20, just before jury selection began for Kessler’s perjury trial.</p><p>Baars isn’t sure why she was subpoenaed, but she said that Kessler’s attorney, Mike Hallahan, told her that he intended to use her testimony to impeach Jay Taylor, the man that Kessler accused of assault. Baars interviewed Taylor for an article about Kessler’s assault claims published on Oct. 10, 2017.</p><p>“During my motions hearing, when Albemarle Circuit Court Judge Cheryl Higgins asked him what questions he intended to ask me, he said it depended on Taylor’s testimony,” she said. </p><p>Hallahan, Kessler’s attorney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Baars said that allowing the subpoena to proceed would have adversely impacted her newsroom. </p><p>“We have a two-man news team here at C-VILLE Weekly, and our other reporter (news editor Lisa Provence) had a different trial to cover that day,” she told Freedom of the Press Foundation. “I was assigned to cover Jason Kessler’s perjury trial, so If I had been sequestered in the witness room, I wouldn’t have been able to do my job.”</p><p>Once the subpoena was quashed, Baars was able cover Kessler’s perjury trial, which lasted less than a day and resulted in the dismissal of the perjury charge against Kessler.</p><p>Baars said that since receiving the subpoena, she has started to question which of her sentences or paragraphs could provoke an attorney to call her to the witness stand. </p><p>“That’s not something I should have to worry about when doing my job,” she said. “If reporters are regularly subpoenaed to testify in court, people could begin to perceive us as an investigative arm of the government. When I’m out reporting, I don’t want to be thinking about what I could be called to testify about in court, and I don’t want that to make potential sources more reluctant to talk to reporters.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Baars_subpoena_top.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['QUASHED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,Samantha Baars,,Jason Kessler,,,,,,,

Before the Channel One reporter could finish asking her question, Nauert interrupted her, dismissed her as being ""from Russian TV"" and refused to answer her question.</p><p>Other journalists in the room objected to Nauert's treatment of the Channel One reporter.</p><p>""They're not officials of the Russian government,"" a CNN reporter said. ""They're just asking a question about Russia.""</p><p>Nauert then said that Russian news organizations are funded and directed by the Russian government, with the implication being that Russian journalists are agents of the Russian government who lack editorial independence.</p><p>The State Department did not immediately return a request for comment. <br/></p><p>Read the full transcript of the exchange below:</p></div></div>

The trial was later postponed until July, freeing Daugherty from the initial subpoena to testify. However, it is possible that the prosecutor could attempt to subpoena him again.</p><p>The subpoena ordered Daugherty to appear and testify in Circuit Court for the City of Portsmouth between March 21 and March 23. Daugherty told Freedom of the Press foundation that he thinks he could have been required to be present in court all three days, but more likely, he would have been told to return close to the specific time when he would have been needed. </p><p>On March 20, Daugherty’s attorney Conrad Shumadine filed a motion to quash the subpoena.</p><p>“The trial subpoena issued to Mr. Daugherty raises serious First Amendment issues,” the motion to quash states. “The Virginian-Pilot and Mr. Daugherty respectfully assert that a prosecutor must have some factual basis to subpoena a reporter for testimony and there has to be some reasonable expectancy that the reporter would be called as a witness.” </p><p>Portsmouth Councilman Mark Whitaker was charged with 20 felonies, including identity fraud and forgery, in April 2017. At that time, the Virginian-Pilot reported that Whitaker and his attorneys claimed that the case was biased or politically motivated. </p><p>In October 2017, Scott Daugherty wrote an article for the Virginian-Pilot about the fact that two of Mark Whitaker’s alleged fraud victims claimed he did nothing wrong. For the piece, he interviewed Mark Whitaker.</p><p>“I&#x27;m not really sure what the special prosecutor wanted to ask me, except it probably had to do with that one story,” Daugherty told Freedom of the Press Foundation. “Quite frankly, this isn&#x27;t a case where I&#x27;d really expect the prosecution to want to ask me any questions on the stand. The councilman has never said anything to me indicating he is guilty. To the contrary, he has been pretty adamant from the beginning that this case is politically motivated and that he will be vindicated.”</p><p>Commonwealth Attorney Andrew Robbins declined to discuss what questions he intended to ask Daugherty or confirm that he would refrain from asking about unpublished information.</p><p>In a March 20 affidavit, Daugherty wrote, “If Mark Whitaker had provided me with any information suggesting or tending to the effect that he was guilty of the offenses, I would have included it in the article I wrote about the interview since any such admission would have been highly newsworthy.” </p><p>On March 20, the prosecution and defense agreed to postpone Whitaker’s fraud trial until July so that a discovery order could be entered and a hearing on an unspecified motion scheduled. </p><p>“At the moment, I am not under subpoena,” Daugherty said on March 30. “I believe the special prosecutor will have to subpoena me again if he wants me to testify during [the] new trial.” </p><p>When asked if he intends to subpoena Daugherty again to testify in Whitaker’s trial in July, Commonwealth Attorney Andrew Robbins said it would depend on how the evidence progresses between now and then. </p><p>“Anyone, reporter or anyone else, who takes a statement from a criminal defendant risks being called as a witness,” he told Freedom of the Press Foundation.  </p><p>Although Daugherty has extensively covered the case since Whitaker was first indicted in April 2017, he would not have been able to report on the trial if the subpoena had proceeded.</p><p>&quot;It would have prevented me from covering the trial, both ethically and physically,&quot; he said. &quot;As a witness, I would have probably been barred from the courtroom until it was my time to testify. We probably would have had to have another reporter cover the trial… a reporter who knew the basics of the case, but not all of the details.” </p><p>“Without even getting to the stress a subpoena places on the relationship between a reporter and his sources, getting [subpoenaed] can effectively prevent a reporter from doing his or her job,” he added. “If you can&#x27;t enter a courtroom, you can&#x27;t cover a trial.”</p></div></div>","On June 25, 2018, a judge quashed the subpoena.",None,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['DROPPED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,Scott Daugherty,,,,,,,,,

Davis ruled that the California shield law did apply to Anderegg and the subpoena should be quashed.</p><p>“He went there as a journalist and turned on his camera, and it stayed on,” judge Davis said, according to the Voice of San Diego.</p><p>This is not the first time that Halgren has helped a journalist fight a subpoena. Earlier this year, he represented Kelly Davis, a freelance reporter who was subpoenaed to testify about her reporting on the high number of deaths in San Diego County jails. The subpoena against Davis was defeated.</p></div></div>","On March 19, the subpoena was quashed.",https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2018-04-27_at_6.57.55.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['QUASHED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,Paul Anderegg,,,,,,,,,

Since Watkins was only informed after the fact, she had no way to challenge the seizure.</p><p>Watkins is a national security reporter at the Times, who previously worked at BuzzFeed, Politico, and McClatchy. In February, she received a letter from the Justice Department, informing her that it had obtained her customer records and subscriber information from Verizon and Google. </p><p>Those records, known as “metadata,” include details of each and every call, text message, and email that she sent between 2014 or so, when she was still an undergraduate intern, and December 2017. The metadata does not include the actual content of her calls and emails, but does include the recipient of each call and email, the duration of each call, and the timestamp of each message.</p><p>The Justice Department seized Watkins’ records as part of an investigation into her confidential sources. Between 2014 and late 2017, Watkins was romantically involved with James Wolfe, the director of security for the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Justice Department began an investigation of Wolfe in connection with the leak of classified information to Watkins and other reporters. In December 2017, FBI agents interviewed Wolfe about his contacts with reporters, including Watkins. Federal investigators also approached Watkins around the same time, but she refused to speak with them.</p><p>In February 2018, a grand jury indicted Wolfe on charges of lying to federal investigators, in connection with statements he allegedly made during the December interview. The indictment accuses Wolfe of making false statements about the extent of his contacts with reporters, including Watkins. It also accuses him of making false statements about disclosing sensitive information to Watkins and another reporter.</p><p>Wolfe has not been indicted on charges of leaking classified information — to Watkins or any other reporters — and Watkins told her editors at the Times that he was not a source of classified information for her.</p><p>The seizure of Watkins’ phone and email records is the first (publicly-known) instance of the Justice Department obtaining a journalist’s communications records since Trump took office.</p><p>In 2013, during the Obama administration, it was revealed that the Justice Department secretly obtained access to a Fox News reporter’s private email account, and to months of phone records belonging to the dozens of Associated Press reporters, in an attempt to identify journalists’ sources.</p><p>After public outcry, the current Justice Department implemented voluntary guidelines in 2015. These guidelines direct the Department of Justice to only subpoena journalists for information as a last resort and require the attorney general to personally approve any subpoena of a journalist or news organization.</p><p>The guidelines also instruct the department to provide news organizations of advance notice of subpoenas and records requests related to journalism, so that the news organizations have a chance to fight the subpoenas in court before they are carried out. The guidelines specifically state that the journalist should be given advance notice, “unless the Attorney General determines that, for compelling reasons, such notice would pose a clear and substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation, risk grave harm to national security, or present an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.”</p><p>Watkins and The New York Times were not given advance notice or the opportunity to challenge the seizure in court. A Justice Department spokeswoman told the Times that the department “fully complied” with its internal guidelines when seizing Watkins’ records.</p><p>The Trump administration has floated the idea of modifying the internal guidelines but so far has not done so. According to the Times, deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein told a group of journalists on June 6, 2018 that the guidelines remained in effect.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/ali_watkins.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,Google,tech company,None,None,Ali Watkins,,,,,,,,,

Following the ruling, the coroner’s office released the autopsy reports to dozens of news organizations. On Feb. 15, The Huffington Post published summaries of all 58 autopsy reports.</p><p>The reports that were released to the press were partially redacted and did not include the victims’ names, ages, or other personal and identifying information.</p><p>One of the 58 autopsy reports pertained to Charles Hartfield, an off-duty Las Vegas police officer who was killed in the shooting. After the autopsy reports were released to the public, Hartfield’s widow, Veronica Hartfield, sued the Review-Journal and AP, arguing that the autopsy report contained private medical information and should remain confidential.</p><p>On Feb. 9, Clark County District Court judge Richard Scotti ruled in favor of Veronica Hartfield, ordering the Review-Journal and the AP to destroy their copies of Hartfield’s autopsy report and to refrain from publishing any details contained in Hartfield’s autopsy report.</p><p>Scotti’s order presented a logistical problem for the Review-Journal and the AP. Since the redacted autopsy reports did not include any of the victims’ identifying information, there was no way for the Review-Journal or the AP to tell which report was Hartfield&#x27;s.</p><p>“The only identifying information in the autopsy reports was gender,” Review-Journal managing editor Glenn Cook told the Freedom of the Press Foundation. </p><p>Cook said that the judge offered the Review-Journal and AP two options, both of which would have infringed on the news organizations&#x27; First Amendment rights.</p><p>“One of the judge’s solutions to this was to hand over all of the information that just been declared public record and was lawfully released, have the Coroner’s Office staff pick out Hartfield’s and promise to give the rest back,” he said. “The most staggering remedy the judge suggested was to allow government employees into our newsroom, go through all of our records, and find that particular report and destroy a legally obtained document.”</p><p>“If anywhere in this country, agents of any government entity were allowed to force their way into a newsroom to rifle through documents and seek out a specific record and destroy it, it would be an unparalleled violation of the press freedoms enshrined in the First Amendment,” he said.</p><p>Cook said that he distributed a memo to the Review-Journal newsroom outlining company-wide procedures in the event that representatives of the coroner’s office or Las Vegas police attempt to enter the paper’s newsroom to find Hartfield’s autopsy report.</p><p>On Feb. 12, the Review-Journal and AP appealed Scotti&#x27;s decision, petitioning the Nevada Supreme Court for an emergency writ that would vacate Scotti&#x27;s order. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the Nevada Press Association filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the news organizations.</p><p>&quot;Prior restraints on speech and publication cause immediate, irrevocable, and irreversible harm — therefore they are almost always intolerable under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution ... Every minute the district court’s order remains in place is another minute of harm suffered by the Media Parties and the public, which is entitled to reporting on the performance of its public agencies,&quot; the petition for an emergency writ states.</p></div></div>",A Las Vegas judge ordered the Review-Journal and AP not to report on a public autopsy report.

His company, which contracted with government agencies to transport the dead, had been accused of mishandling bodies for over two years. In June, the Office of the State Medical Examiner severed its ties with Fantasia’s company, but it still holds contracts with other agencies.</p><p>“We wanted to photograph him, and see if he was still working in the funeral industry, or going into a funeral home,” Stirling told Freedom of the Press Foundation.</p><p>Stirling and Mills waited in their car outside of Fantasia’s house for several hours before he emerged. Once Fantasia exited the house, Stirling said, he “got into his car and drove at us.”</p><p>Stirling said that Fantasia drove his black Cadillac Escalade down the road, pulled up next to the journalists’ car window, and began yelling obscenities.</p><p>Stirling said that after he identified himself as a reporter and made several attempts to interview Fantasia, Mills made the decision to leave out of concern for their safety. Mills declined to comment.</p><p>“Joe [Fantasia] has a history of violent threats—that’s part of what we documented,” Stirling said.</p><p>Stirling said that Fantasia chased them around the neighborhood and then a second black SUV, driven by Fantasia’s neighbor, joined the chase. Both SUVs followed Stirling and Mills onto nearby Route 46.</p><p>“At this point, we were on the phone with 911,” Stirling said. “Joe’s car pulled up alongside and got in front of us, and the other car got behind us, so we were boxed in.”</p><p>Stirling said that the Fantasia’s neighbor’s SUV then moved to the side of their car and slowed down. Stirling said this gave them no choice but to stop, blocking the flow of traffic across the entire highway.</p><p>A police report of the incident obtained by Freedom of the Press Foundation reads, “At this time the driver of the Escalade later identified as Joseph Fantasia exited his vehicle, began to approach the Nissan Altima and was telling in there direction.”</p><p>“They were moving at us aggressively, but thankfully, we didn&#x27;t have the chance to see what could have happened next — but it wouldn’t have been good,” Stirling said.</p><p>Luckily, Stirling said, one of the cars behind them held two off duty police officers. The officers pulled up alongside the cars, identified themselves, and ordered all three cars to pull over down the road.</p><p>“They put their car in between ours and both of theirs, and they made sure on-duty police officers were on their way,” Stirling said.</p><p>“They stayed until they arrived. I don’t know what would have happened if they weren’t there. They made the best out of what was a bad, scary situation.”</p><p>The altercation was written up as a road rage incident, but neither Fantasia nor his neighbor were arrested or charged for the incident.</p><p>“If there&#x27;s anything that bothers me as a citizen about this, that’s it,” Stirling said. “Two off duty police officers saw what happened. It’s disappointing that not even a reckless driving citation was issued — it’s hard for me to feel like that doesn’t send a bad message.”</p><p>On March 5, Stirling’s article about Fantasia was published.</p></div></div>",,None,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,private individual,yes,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,"Andrew Mills, Stephen Stirling",,,,,,,,,

Victor said that there were three other people in the car with him — two KZAA colleagues, who each had a press pass, and a local resident who knew the person that Victor planned to interview.</p><p>Victor said that he and his colleagues showed their press passes to the CHP officer, whom he identified as “T. Adrianse,” but the officer did not believe that the press passes were authentic.</p><p>Victor said that CHP officer Adrianse photographed him, as well as his drivers license and license plate, and then threatened to arrest him for being in an exclusionary zone and for possession of (what the officer believed to be) a fraudulent press pass.</p><p>Victor was released without being arrested, but he was unable to complete the interview (since he couldn’t get access to the exclusion zone) and his press pass was never returned to him.</p><p>On Jan. 10, Santa Barbara County declared a “public safety exclusion zone” near Montecito, California, due to dangerous mudslides. Under California law, authorities can prevent members of the public from accessing exclusion zones, but they are supposed to allow any “duly authorized representative of any news service, newspaper, or radio or television station” to enter the area.</p><p>The Santa Barbara California Highway Patrol told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that it has had issues in the past with non-journalists attempting to access exclusion zones.</p><p>“I will let you know we have an issue with people posing as press employees to gain access to the evacuation zone,” Santa Barbara CHP officer Jonathan Gutierrez said. “Every time there is a disaster there is always an issue of looters.”</p><p>Gutierrez said that Adrianse, the officer who stopped Victor, believed that the press pass looked to be homemade and therefore fraudulent.</p><p>“The press passes looked to be fake and could have easily been home made on a basic printer,” he said. “The officer obtained the alleged press pass and called the sergeant on duty, he took a picture and forwarded it to the sergeant who also agreed the passes looked to be fake.”</p><p>Gutierrez also said that officer Adrianse had other reasons to suspect that Victor was not a legitimate journalist covering the mudslides. He said that Adrianse had tried to verify that Victor was a real journalist by using his mobile phone to search online for KZAA’s coverage of the mudslides. When he found KZAA’s Facebook page and saw that it had not posted or shared any stories about the mudslides, he concluded that Victor was not really a journalist on assignment.</p><p>“The officer believed Mr. Lopez was not doing a story about the Montecito mudslide but abusing his position as an employee at a local radio station to travel freely in and out the Montecito Evacuation zone,” Gutierrez said.</p><p>Gutierrez added that Victor and other journalists seeking to access the exclusion zone should apply for official press passes from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department.</p><p>Victor told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that the KZAA press passes were of “poor quality,” but he was still surprised to be stopped because CHP officers had previously accepted the passes.</p><p>“In this zone, there were several roadblocks/checkpoints which we got through, but this officer decided our passes were fraudulent,” he said.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/15757801561_6971d6d5ee_k.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,in custody,False,law enforcement,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,Marcus Victor,,,,,,,,,

On Dec. 19, Wiggins lifted the stay.</p><p>The temporary stay issued by Justice David Wiggins blocked the newspaper from publishing information about Des Moines attorney Jaysen McCleary obtained from private medical records.</p><p>“A temporary stay is imposed until the supreme court rules on McCleary&#x27;s combined applications,” Wiggins wrote in the order. “Pending further order from this court, the defendants shall not disclose or share (other than with legal counsel) any information in the defendants&#x27; possession that was obtained exclusively from the reports.”</p><p>The records in question were first made public in July 2017, when they were filed by McCleary’s attorney as part of a personal injury suit that he brought against the city of Des Moines (<i>Jaysen McCleary v. City of Des Moine</i>s). The records probably should have been filed under seal, but they were not, which, which meant that any member of the public could (theoretically) access them.</p><p>McCleary told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that the records containing his private information were mistakenly attached to expert reports that were filed publicly by his attorney. </p><p>In November, Des Moines Register reporter Clark Kauffman obtained a copy of the private records and asked McCleary for comment about them. Soon after, McCleary settled with the city of Des Moines and asked for <i>McCleary v. City of Des Moines</i> to be dismissed.</p><p>On Nov. 16, McCleary filed a motion in <i>McCleary v. City of Des Moine</i>s, asking the District Court to seal the expert reports containing his private records. District Court judge Jeffrey Farrell granted the motion and issued a protective order. The protective order prohibits the parties in <i>McCleary v. City of Des Moines</i> — i.e., McCleary, the city of Des Moines, and their attorneys — from disseminating the sealed records to the public. The order also requires that any “third parties” in possession of the sealed records destroy them. </p><p>On Nov. 27, McCleary sued Kauffman and the Register in District Court (<i>McCleary v. Kauffman</i>), claiming that Kauffman conspired with the city of Des Moines to defame him and damage his reputation.</p><p>McCleary then filed a motion in <i>McCleary v. Kauffman</i> asking for a temporary injunction. McCleary asked the court to order the Register not to publish any articles including information gleaned from his medical records. He also argued that the paper had violated the protective order issued in <i>McCleary v. City of Des Moines</i>, which instructed “third parties” in possession of the records to destroy them.</p><p>On Dec. 7, District Court judge Eliza Ovrom denied the motion for a temporary injunction, ruling that the Register was not subject to the protective order.</p><p>“Mr. McCleary alleges that Clark Kauffman obtained copies of said reports during the period they were part of the public court file,” Ovrom wrote in her order. “Even if true, this court cannot enjoin publication of the reports, as such an injunction would violate the First Amendment and Article I, Section 7. Moreover, the defendants in this case were not parties to [<i>McCleary v. City of Des Moines</i>], and are not bound by orders in that case.”</p><p>On Dec. 8, McCleary filed an application to show cause in <i>McCleary v. City of Des Moines</i>, essentially asking District Court judge Farrell to hold the Register in contempt of court for violating the protective order.</p><p>Farrell denied the motion on the grounds that the Register was not subject to the protective order.</p><p>“The application must be denied for the same reasons noted by Judge Ovrom,” Farrell wrote. “Neither Mr. Kauffman nor the Register are parties to this case, and thus, neither are subject to the protective order. As a result, the application is denied.”</p><p>McCleary appealed both District Court decisions to the Iowa Supreme Court.</p><p>On Dec. 11, Wiggins ordered that the Register not publish the records until court had ruled on McCleary’s appeal. </p><p>Wiggins may have seen the order as a typical procedural ruling, intended to ensure that the Iowa Supreme Court had a chance to consider the merits of McCleary’s appeal before the Register published the records.</p><p>But whatever his intention, Wiggins’ order had serious First Amendment implications. The Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly ruled that the First Amendment prohibits the government from preventing a newspaper from publishing information, barring extraordinary circumstances in which national security is at stake.</p><p>On Dec. 19, after the Register had filed a response to McCleary&#x27;s appeal and McCleary had filed a reply to the response, Wiggins lifted the stay and issued an order denying McCleary&#x27;s appeal. </p><p>Wiggins defended his decision to issue the temporary stay.</p><p>&quot;The stay was strictly temporary in nature, its duration limited to the time necessary for the filing of the defendants’ response, the plaintiff’s reply, and this court’s entry of a ruling on the plaintiff’s combined applications,&quot; he wrote in the order.</p><p>McCleary then asked a three-judge panel to review Wiggins&#x27; decision, but the panel affirmed Wiggins&#x27; ruling and denied McCleary&#x27;s appeal.</p><p>McCleary told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that he now plans to appeal his case to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>On Dec. 20, the Des Moines Register published an article about McCleary that included information obtained from his medical records.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Polk_County_Courthouse_Des_Moines.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,"<p>The Polk County courthouse in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>",None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,dropped,Clark Kauffman,,,,,,,,,

He said in May 2008 that approximately 50 armed soldiers entered his home without a permit claiming they were searching for “weapons or drugs,” but left after finding no evidence of unlawful activity. At the time, he was writing for the Chihuahua-based El Diario del Noroeste.</p><p>In June 2008, he said, a source informed him that he was on a “hit list” due to his reporting on the military, and he fled Mexico with his then-15-year-old son, Oscar.</p><p>Eduardo Beckett, Gutierrez’s attorney, told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that Gutiérrez was offered physical protection by the Mexican government but declined it because he doubted the government’s ability to effectively protect him.</p><p>In 2008, Gutiérrez claimed political asylum at a border checkpoint in Columbus, New Mexico, and he and his son were taken to separate detention facilities in El Paso, Texas. His son was released to family in the United States in August 2008, and Gutiérrez was released in January 2009.</p><p>While awaiting an asylum decision, Gutierrez and his son settled in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and regularly completed their required check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p><p>On July 19, 2017, nearly a decade after Gutiérrez’s original application for asylum, El Paso immigration judge Robert Hough denied his asylum request, ruling that Gutiérrez’s testimony was not credible, he had not sufficiently established fear of torture, and he had failed to show that the Mexican government could not protect him.</p><p>Beckett, Gutiérrez’s lawyer, believes that the judge underestimated the risks that Mexican journalists face. He said that, although Gutiérrez has not received specific threats from the Mexican military since entering the United States, the reporter still believes he would be killed if he returned to Mexico.</p><p>“The threat is still viable, and military people have long memories,” Beckett said.</p><p>Outside of war zones, Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world for journalists. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 42 journalists and media workers were killed there in 2017 alone.</p><p>On Nov. 20, 2017, Gutiérrez’s attorney filed an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals, asking that the board reopen Gutiérrez&#x27;s asylum case and grant Gutierrez a temporary stay of removal, which would prevent ICE from deporting him while the board considered his appeal.</p><p>On Dec. 7, Gutiérrez and his son attended a routine check-in with ICE, but were unexpectedly detained, according to Beckett. ICE agents served Gutiérrez and his son with deportation papers, and walked them back towards the port of entry. When Beckett acquired an emergency stay of deportation, Gutiérrez and his son were taken to an ICE facility instead of being immediately deported.</p><p>Beckett said that it was technically legal for ICE to deport his client, since an immigration judge had previously denied Gutiérrez&#x27;s asylum request. But he said that the detention and attempted deportation was still very unexpected and unusual, since Gutiérrez had an appeal pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals and there were irregularities in the case.</p><p>On Dec. 22, the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed to reconsider Gutiérrez&#x27;s deportation order.

Nasser said that he was wearing his headphones and was holding his recorder with a mic on it as he was returning to the U.S.-side of the border.</p><p>Nasser noticed a sign posted at the U.S. facility which specified that cameras, video cameras and cellphones were not allowed — Nasser said he assumed that audio recording was fine. He told CPJ that he continued recording throughout handing over his passport and having “very normal” exchanges with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer.</p><p>When the officer saw his recorder, Nasser said the officer “freaked out.” Nasser said the officer asked what it was and whether he was currently recording, to which he responded yes. Nasser told CPJ that the officer then effectively shut down to entire line, ordered Nasser to stop recording and called for other officers to assist him.</p><p>The officers directed Nasser to a secondary screening room where they had him wait with another man, and placed his belongings — including his audio recorder, passport and green card — on a desk in his eyesight but out of his reach.

Nasser told CPJ he offered to delete it, and after some awkward fumbling he did so.</p><p>At the end of the encounter, which Nasser said lasted around 2 to 2.5 hours, a final officer — who was wearing a kevlar vest with “DHS” printed on it — approached him and said that he hadn’t technically done anything wrong, but that his actions had been suspicious.</p><p>“We were just doing our jobs,” Nasser recalled the officer saying.

There Jamieson noticed his boarding pass was flagged with “SSSS.”</p><p>Jamieson told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that his boarding pass had often been flagged with the marker used to signal travelers for secondary screening, which he believed was due to his reporting trips to the Middle East and unusual travel patterns. He added that since registering with CBP’s Global Entry trusted traveler program a few years before, he had not been flagged.</p><p>Jamieson told the Tracker that after he landed at Miami International Airport at around 7:30pm, the automated machines at U.S. Customs flagged his picture with a red ‘X’ and he was directed into the normal processing line, a first for him since applying for Global Entry.</p><p>“When I got to an agent, he immediately sent me off, without explanation, to the secondary questioning area, so I knew I was in for a long wait,” Jamieson said.</p><p>The secondary screening, Jamieson told the Tracker, was “wild.”</p><p>“I had expected a long wait,” he said. “I had not expected to be barked at by CBP agents who were trying to create a kind of ‘boot camp’ atmosphere in which everyone was intimidated and in fear of giving the wrong answer.”</p><p>The CBP officer, whom Jamieson identified as Officer Jones, confiscated his phone and kept it out of his view. Jamieson noted that because he had a screen lock, he does not believe it was accessed or searched. Officer Jones questioned him over the course of an hour, repeatedly using the term “fake news” in reference to his job and asking inappropriate questions about his romantic life.</p><p>“She knew my job without asking, and had clearly Googled my social media profile. She would ask why someone ‘with a good job at an American company’ would visit ‘these kind of countries,’” Jamieson said, referring to Turkey and other Middle Eastern states. “She then went through the list of my Facebook friends to ask which ones were friends or which ones I’d had sex with, or both.”</p></div></div>

On March 19, 2018, she was caught recording inside the courthouse once again, which led to a third count of willful disobedience of a court order. <br/></p><p>A jury trial on all four counts is scheduled to begin on March 4.<br/></p><p>On Nov. 29, 2018, Bassi filed a federal lawsuit against Santa Clara County, alleging that her civil rights were violated. That suit has been stayed pending the outcome of Bassi’s criminal trial.<br/></p><p>Rules regarding taking pictures in courtrooms vary significantly from court to court. Bassi’s attorney, Dmitry Stadlin, believes that the local court order is not only vague and overly broad, but also might not be legal.<br/></p><p>“This local rule does not provide definite guidelines for the police in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement,” Stadlin wrote in a demurrer. “The local court rule which bans all photography and recordings is a prior restraint on free speech, and thus subjects to close judicial scrutiny and permissible in only the most extraordinary circumstances.”</p><p><i>Editor's note: This article was updated to insert hyperlinks.</i></p><p><i>— The<a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</a> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

She was ordered to testify at a deposition and turn over materials related to her reporting on the high number of deaths in San Diego County jails. On Feb. 2, 2018, a federal magistrate ruled in favor of Davis, defeating the subpoena.</p><p>Davis has been writing about deaths in San Diego jails for years. In 2013, while working at San Diego City Beat, she and colleague Dave Maass reported that San Diego County had the highest inmate mortality rate out of California’s largest jail systems. Since then, her reporting has been cited in a number of wrongful death lawsuits and complaints filed against San Diego County. </p><p>The widow of Kris Nesmith, an inmate who died while in prison, sued the County of San Diego in 2015. At the time, Davis wrote an article about the lawsuit for the San Diego Union-Tribune.</p><p>In November 2017, attorneys for San Diego County subpoenaed Davis, seeking her testimony as well as her unpublished research related to her reporting.</p><p>The subpoena orders Davis to appear at a deposition on December 11 and to produce “any and all documents, notes, and recordings, including in electronic format, that you relied on when reporting and/or publishing that the San Diego County’s incarceration mortality rate ‘leads in California’s largest jails.’”</p><p>“They wanted everything, written or electronic,” Davis told the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “It was a huge fishing investigation to try to get every nook and cranny of information that I had.”</p><p>Maass, who co-wrote the 2013 San Diego City Beat story with Davis, was not subpoenaed in the case. He never wrote specifically about the Kris Nesmith case, and he no longer lives in San Diego or writes about the county’s jails. He criticized San Diego County for attempting to subpoena Davis.</p><p>“This subpoena is of course frightening when it comes to press freedom, but as someone who worked on these stories, it’s concerning that this is how they address safety issues in their jails,” he said. “Rather than address them and stop killing people, the county comes after the messengers who did this research.” </p><p>After Davis’ attorneys objected to the subpoena, San Diego County filed a motion to compel Davis’ testimony. In the motion to compel, attorneys for San Diego County argued that, since Davis&#x27; reporting would be cited during the trial, they should be allowed to question her like an expert witness.</p><p>“They wanted to cut undercut my reporting and to challenge the methodology that my colleague and I initially used,” Davis said. </p><p>On Feb. 2, federal magistrate judge Andrew Schopler ruled in favor of Davis, defeating the subpoena. Davis will not have to testify or hand over her unpublished reporting materials. </p><p>San Diego County did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>",Davis has reported for years on the high number of deaths in San Diego County jails,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/kellydavis.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,journalist communications or work product,['QUASHED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,Kelly Davis,,,,,,,,,

Stark said that the officer then told him to stay away from the Gillespie campaign bus, which he refused to do since he was covering Gillespie.</p><p>“I was standing in the street on the far side of the driveway filming the Gillespie RV in anticipation of him disembarking,” Stark said in a statement. “That&#x27;s when I heard the policeman tell me to get out of the road. I complied, and then he told me to leave the Gillespie vehicle and everyone inside it alone. At that point I told the policeman he&#x27;d probably have to arrest me to keep me away from Gillespie. He responded that he would arrest me and approached me aggressively. The ‘conversation’ escalated from there.”</p><p>A video of the arrest shows Stark complying with Rogers’ order to step backward, while continuing to argue with him, as a woman in a red jacket and an additional police officer involve themselves in the exchange. (Stark said that he believes that the woman in the red jacket was associated with the campaign.)</p><p>After Stark says “Fuck this,” the arresting officer — whom Stark later identified as Mason District Police Captain T.J. Rogers — places his hand on Stark’s right shoulder and turns him against a nearby fence. While Stark has both of his hands behind his back, the officer lifts Stark’s right ankle off the ground, sending the reporter face-first into the sidewalk. </p><p>As additional officers rush to the scene, Stark says, “Stop, I will give you my arm. I can’t. You have your weight on top of me. I cannot give you my hand. My hand is beneath me.” Five officers eventually pin Stark to the ground with their knees on the back of his head and his body. They continue demanding his arm as he screams that he cannot comply and begs them to stop.</p><p>Stark told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that officers punched him repeatedly in the legs during the physical takedown and said that his attorney told him that this is a common “softening” technique used against non-cooperative subjects.</p><p>The takedown left Stark with an abrasion to his head and a few bruises. He refused treatment at the time of the arrest. </p><p>“I’ve got a nice bruise on my hip and an ugly scrape on my elbow,” he said. “But as I&#x27;ve said elsewhere, I don&#x27;t consider this arrest to have been brutal. Violent? Yes. Brutal? No.”</p><p>Stark also said that his phone was broken during the incident, and he suspects that the officers may have deliberately thrown it against the ground.</p><p>“My brand new phone, a OnePlus 5 that came with Gorilla Glass, was broken during the arrest,” he said. “I don&#x27;t think it was an accident. When I was on the ground, I heard what sounded like a cell phone striking the pavement immediately after it had been retrieved from my hand attached to the arm stuck beneath my body.”</p><p>Stark was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest and held in custody for nearly five hours, before being released on a $3,000 bond.</p><p>After Shareblue published video of the arrest on October 31, Fairfax County Police Chief Edwin C. Roessler held a press conference, during which he defended the arrest and said that it was appropriate for the officers to use a physical takedown technique on Stark because the reporter was passively resisting arrest. (Stark said that he did not resist the officers, but was only trying to put his phone away when the officers took him down.)</p><p>Roessler told the press that the officer who arrested Stark might have feared for his safety.</p><p>“You must understand that, from the officer’s perspective, he does not know who this gentleman is,” Roessler said. “The gentleman is wearing a hooded sweatshirt. He does not know if this gentleman has a concealed weapon. He does not know what intent this gentleman has, whether it’s to create harm or something else.”</p><p>Stark said that he explicitly identified himself as a journalist to the officers who arrested him.</p><p>Roessler told the press that the officer who arrested Stark may not have believed Stark when he said that he was a journalist.</p><p>“He doesn’t know him personally or who he is, and anybody can say anything,” Roessler said. </p><p>Stark, who has written critically about Gillespie’s campaign, said that the campaign has previously had him removed from events held on private property and has “disinvited” him from the press pool. He believes that the campaign may have asked the police to remove him from the area near the Gillespie campaign bus.</p><p>During the press conference, police chief Roessler said that he did not know whether the Gillespie campaign had any conversations with the police concerning Stark.</p><p>“I have no knowledge of that right now,” Roeller said. “We are investigating this. And if there are any witnesses I would ask that they contact the Fairfax County Police Department. Our Internal Affairs Bureau is actively going out seeking witnesses and networking the community to understand the full picture here, and as I mentioned earlier, our police auditor will also review our completed investigation and report our findings to the community.”</p><p>A police spokesperson referred the Freedom of the Press Foundation to Roessler&#x27;s press conference and declined to comment further.</p></div></div>

He won a George Polk award for his coverage of the McDonald case.</p><p>In February 2015, he published an article in Slate titled “Sixteen Shots,” which reported on evidence, including an autopsy report and statements from witnesses, that contradicted the Chicago police department’s public account of McDonald’s shooting. Kalven also reported on the existence of an unreleased police dash-cam video, which had captured the shooting. After public pressure and a court decision forced the city of Chicago to release the dash-cam video to the public, officer Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder.</p><p>As part of his defense strategy, Van Dyke’s lawyer is trying to force Kalven to testify about his sources.</p><p>Kalven told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that he received a subpoena at his office on Oct. 16, 2017, ordering him to appear in court at 9 a.m. on the following day. Kalven said that he did not attend the Oct. 17 hearing and that his attorney informed Van Dyke’s attorney that he could not attend the hearing on such short notice.</p><p>During the hearing, Van Dyke’s defense attorney argued that Kalven needed to be called in to testify, according to an audio recording of the hearing taped by a journalist in attendance. Van Dyke’s legal team hopes to show that Kalven received leaked documents from the police oversight agency investigating the shooting and that he could have influenced potential witnesses in the case by interviewing them about the murder while reporting the Slate piece.</p><p>Chicago judge Vincent Gaughan seemed receptive to the defense team’s argument, though he did acknowledge that Illinois’ “press shield law” prevents journalists from being compelled to name their sources in some circumstances.</p><p>“The reporter’s privilege concerning the source will have to be litigated,” he said. </p><p>On Nov. 3, Kalven’s attorney filed a motion to quash the subpoena, citing the Illinois Reporter&#x27;s Privilege Act. </p><p>The state law requires a person seeking to compel a reporter to testify about their confidential sources to file a detailed application with the court, which must include &quot;the name of the reporter and of the news medium with which he or she was connected at the time the information sought was obtained; the specific information sought and its relevancy to the proceedings; and [a] specific public interest which would be adversely affected if the factual information sought were not disclosed.&quot;</p><p>The law also sets a high bar for a court to approve such an application; the court must find &quot;that all other available sources of information have been exhausted and [that] disclosure of the information sought is essential to the protection of the public interest involved.&quot;</p><p>Kalven&#x27;s motion to quash the subpoena stated that Van Dyke&#x27;s legal team had not filed an application to overcome his reporter&#x27;s privilege and therefore had not met their burden on the Reporter&#x27;s Privilege Act. Van Dyke&#x27;s attorney later filed an opposition to Kalven&#x27;s motion to quash the subpoena. This opposition was filed under seal, so it is not clear what legal argument it makes.</p><p>On Dec. 5, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (a founding partner of the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker) led a group of 18 journalism and press freedom publications in filing an amicus brief in support of Kalven’s motion to quash the subpoena. In the amicus brief, RCFP wrote that “the public interest in protecting confidential sources is particularly compelling in this case” and argued that that the Reporter’s Privilege Act should protect Kalven from being forced to testify about his sources.</p><p>On Dec. 6, the court will hear arguments for and against the motion to quash the subpoena.</p><p>Kalven said that even if the motion to quash is denied, he will only answer questions to the extent that his sources are not jeopardized.</p><p>“I can imagine no situation in which I would reveal my source,” he said. </p><p>Kalven is not new to requests to surrender the details of his work. In 2005, the City of Chicago subpoenaed Kalven, seeking his notes, tapes, and other records gathered during reporting on abuse of police power. When he refused to comply, the court moved to hold him in contempt, but the threat dissipated when the case was resolved. </p><p>“I don’t want to say that I’m completely unconcerned about this,” he said. “But I have no internal conflict or anguish about what I should do.”</p></div></div>","On December 13, a judge quashed the subpoena for Kalven to testify.",https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/jamie_kalven_dnainfo.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,testimony about confidential source,['QUASHED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,Jamie Kalven,,"Chicago police department, Laquan McDonald",,,,,,,

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Rosenworcel&#x27;s tweet included a link to a document on the FCC’s website titled “The Public and Broadcasting,” which outlines the agency’s regulation of broadcasts.</p><p>“We license only individual broadcast stations,” the document states. “We do not license TV or radio networks (such as CBS, NBC, ABC or Fox) or other organizations with which stations have relationships (such as PBS or NPR), except to the extent that those entities may also be station licensees.”</p><p>While the FCC regulates which local TV stations can broadcast over the air, it does not — and cannot — regulate which networks those stations broadcast. The agency could deny licenses to local stations directly owned by NBC, but doing so would not prevent other stations from broadcasting NBC News. If the FCC did attempt to deny broadcast licenses to NBC-owned stations in retaliation for the network&#x27;s coverage of Trump, it would likely be challenged in court and lose on First Amendment grounds.</p><p>The Radio Television Digital News Association (which is a partner of the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker) condemned Trump’s tweet.</p><p>“Today’s call by the President of the United States to challenge the licenses of networks is not only dangerous to the American people’s right to access responsible journalism, it represents a clear misunderstanding on his part of how much control the federal government can exercise as it relates to networks and cable channels,” RTDNA executive director Dan Shelley said.</p><p>Trump is not the first president to try to retaliate against journalism organizations by challenging broadcast licenses. </p><p>Newton Minnow, a former FCC director, writes in the Chicago Tribune that John F. Kennedy once called him up to complain that NBC News was broadcasting false information about him.</p><p>&quot;I was at home one evening when Kennedy called, furious because of a television news story,&quot; Minnow recalls. &quot;Executives in the steel industry announced a price increase, which the president believed was a violation of an agreement he had negotiated to avoid a strike. He asked if I had seen NBC&#x27;s newscast in which the steel companies&#x27; execs bitterly attacked the president. I had. The president bellowed: &#x27;Did you see how those guys lied about me? Outrageous! Do something about it!&#x27;&quot;</p><p>Minnow refused to do anything and Kennedy dropped the matter.</p><p>In the 1970s, Richard Nixon and his allies took more serious steps, challenging the broadcast licenses of local TV stations owned by The Washington Post. </p><p>“In 1973, the Associated Press reported on the effort from George Champion Jr., who had been finance chairman for Nixon&#x27;s campaign in Florida, to challenge the license of a Jacksonville, Fla., TV station — WJXT-TV,” Post reporter Aaron Blake writes. “The station was then owned by Newsweek and The Washington Post Co., which also owned The Washington Post. The Post was at that point well into its Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate investigation of the president.”</p><p>Despite Nixon’s efforts, the FCC renewed the broadcast license for WJXT-TV and other stations owned by the Post.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2017-10-11_at_7.47.55.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,NBC,NBC,Donald Trump,,,,,,,

	<div class=""rich-text""><p>When he was arrested, Mr. Faulk was standing on a sidewalk reporting on the protests. He was not impeding vehicular or pedestrian traffic. He was clearly identified and credentialed as a reporter for the Post-Dispatch and repeatedly advised several of the arresting officers of his status. Nonetheless, he was rounded up and restrained by police officers who surrounded a large group of people and prevented them from leaving the perimeter in a mechanism we understand is referred to as &quot;kettling.&quot; Independent of whether the &quot;kettle&quot; containment activity was proper under the circumstances (and as the Post-Dispatch has reported, there are serious questions about that), there was no reason why a credentialed reporter should have been arrested or restrained from doing his job of reporting the events. Once the reporter was clearly identified as such, he should have been released immediately and allowed to continue his newsgathering activity.</p><p>Moreover, as we understand the situation, Mr. Faulk was not merely restrained and arrested. While standing on the sidewalk and making no resistance , he was forcefully pushed to the ground by police officers and a police officer&#x27;s boot was placed on his head. As a result of this unneeded and inappropriate force, Mr. Faulk suffered injury to both legs, his back and wrist. Even after being restrained with zip ties and totally subdued, a police officer deliberately sprayed him in the face with pepper spray, mace or some other stinging substance. At some point during the evening, an officer also took it upon himself to review the contents of the cell phone Mr. Faulk was using to communicate and photograph the events of the evening. A bike he was using during his news coverage has not been returned to him. He was held for over thirteen hours in jail, even though one of our editors was at the jail only two hours after the arrest to secure his release. That editor was lied to by jail personnel who told her that he was still in transport, even though he was already at the jail. Jail personnel denied his repeated requests for medical attention. </p></div>

There is simply no justification for his arrest and mistreatment. There has been a noticeable uptick in assaults and arrests of reporters in recent months. This is a dangerous trend that impedes journalists’ right to report and the people’s right to know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Journalism is the only profession protected by name in the Constitution,&quot; St. Louis SPJ chapter president Elizabeth Donald said in a statement. &quot;The First Amendment is not a whimsical academic concept to be dismissed when it becomes inconvenient – or embarrassing to the police.

According to the complaint, officers did not indicate that the filmmakers should not enter the area or that a mass arrest was imminent.</p><p>Shortly after, a line of police started advancing toward the demonstrators. According to the complaint, an apartment tenant allowed Alston’s assistant to enter the building and escape the marching line of police, but Alston was unable to do the same. Alston then noticed a second line of police approaching from the opposite direction, beginning to box in all those present while pounding their batons against their shields and the ground.</p><p>While continuing to film, Alston and a few other people approached the line of bicycle police who made up one side of the kettle so they could ask to leave.

His camera was returned to him upon his release, but it had been badly damaged and pieces of his lighting equipment — including a lighting fixture and its power source — were lost when he was roughly cuffed.</p><p>According to the complaint, Alston continues to suffer physical and psychological repercussions from his arrest and assault, including persistent numbness in his hand, chronic respiratory issues and nightmares.

Why the fuck would you come over here though? You know you shouldn’t be over here. You should get your ass somewhere where you belong. Why the fuck are you trying to fuck my movement? Get your ass away and find you something better to do. Get the fuck out of my movement, motherfucker. And I’m saying it in your motherfucking face.”</p><p>At that point the man steps directly in the path of Gray who steps backward, briefly surrounded by commotion, before he’s pulled forward by the crew filming and several friendly protesters.

He said that a protester knocked his phone into his head while he was conducting an interview. The phone cut his face and forced him to receive treatment at an urgent care clinic.<br/></p><p>“I was holding my phone out in front of me while recording, and my assailant came up to me and knocked my phone directly into my face,” Karacostas said.<br/></p><p>The Student Press Law Center published audio of the incident and immediate aftermath.<br/></p><p>While his attacker re-joined the protest, Karacostas finished his interview and addressed his injury.<br/></p><p>“At first I thought it was just a bruise, but then I noticed blood,” he said.<br/></p><p>London Gibson, a campus reporter for The Daily Texan who also covered the demonstration, told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that she was interviewing another bystander when the altercation occurred.<br/></p><p>“When I turned around, Chase’s face was covered in blood,” she said.<br/></p><p>Karacostas said that he walked with his editor, Ellie Breed, to an urgent care center several blocks away, where he received six stitches near his eyebrow.</p><p>Karacostas identified the assailant as Eric Nava-Perez, a member of Sanctuary UT, one of the groups that organized the protest. Nava-Perez was arrested by the Austin Police Department and charged with assault. According to the Student Press Law Center, Nava-Perez was held for 12 hours at Travis County Jail and has been banned from entering UT Austin’s campus without permission from the dean.</p><p>Nava-Perez did not respond to a request for comment, but Charles Holm, an organizer with Sanctuary UT, criticized Nava-Perez’s arrest. In an interview with the Freedom of the Press Foundation, Holm said that the university’s tactics of policing had contributed to an unsafe atmosphere at the protest and that Nava-Perez felt harassed and defensive due to the presence of police and right-wing bystanders. Jennifer Campbell, another organizer with Sanctuary UT, said that there were multiple police departments present at the protest.<br/></p><p>Holm said there was confusion at the protest as to who was a reporter, since multiple bystanders were documenting the demonstration and because the student journalists did not yet have their press badges for the semester. He said that Nava-Perez may have thought that Karacostas was a right wing heckler.<br/></p><p>Holm said that, while the altercation was an unfortunate event in which a reporter was regrettably injured, he does not believe it was symbolic of an attack on press freedom.<br/></p><p>“There was a general atmosphere of tension that created a chaotic situation,” Holm said.</p><p>Karacostas said that, although he was interviewing a bystander who disagreed with the message of the protest, there was no reason to believe he was with the alt-right. Even if he were sympathetic to the alt-right, he added, “it’s still not okay to knock phones into people’s faces and injure them.”</p><p>Karacostas was surprised by the randomness of the attack, and in contrast to Holm’s account, both he and Gibson described the atmosphere of the protest leading up to the altercation as relatively calm. Karacostas said that he remains committed to his work as a reporter.</p><p>“A lot of blood wasn’t going to stop me from recording,” he said.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/smallereditIMGL0825.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,<p>Chase Karacostas</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,private individual,yes,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,Chase Karacostas,,"protest, ""student journalism""",,,,,,,

Around 390,000 barrels of oil per day flow through Enbridge&#x27;s Line 3, originating at the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, then stretching across northern Minnesota to the company&#x27;s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin, <a href=""https://www.wpr.org/6-arrested-trespassing-enbridge-pipeline-construction-site"">according</a> to Wisconsin Public Radio.</p><p>Hosea was filming from a public road as well as from the side of the road where the excavator was located. When a Douglas County Sheriff’s Deputy asked her to move off the side of the road, she complied. “In under 10 seconds I had obeyed their orders,” Hosea told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p><p>Footage from the protest is included in Hosea&#x27;s 2019 film about clean water, &quot;Thirst for Justice.&quot; The incident in question can be seen at the 2:49 to 3:12 minute mark on the film&#x27;s <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ThirstForJusticeDocumentary/videos/490055155118367/"">trailer</a>. &quot;You&#x27;re under arrest, too,&quot; one of the deputies tells her.</p><p>Deputies arrested Hosea along with the activists, and even though she informed them she was a journalist, she was still searched and detained. &quot;I was just not recognized as a journalist,&quot; Hosea told the Tracker. &quot;There were five activists and there was me, we were all being lumped together.&quot;</p><p>Hosea was charged with one count of disorderly conduct and trespass to land. Two activists faced the same charges, and three others were charged with resisting an officer, disorderly conduct and trespass to land. Hosea posted bond and was released, but her video camera was was not returned to her for another two months, rendering her unable to continue work on her film.</p><p>On Feb. 12, 2018, Hosea pleaded no contest to the trespass charge and received a $358 fine, according to court records<a href=""https://www.superiortelegram.com/news/4413400-public-record""> published</a> by the Superior Telegram. The disorderly conduct charge was dismissed. First Amendment lawyer Henry Kaufman represented her on a pro bono basis.</p><p>In order to start a journalism fellowship at the University of Michigan&#x27;s School of Environment and Sustainability, Hosea, a British citizen, had to leave the country to renew her U.S. visa while the charges were still pending. Due to the charges, she was called into a special interview at the U.S. Embassy. &quot;I was very lucky I got my visa,&quot; she told the Tracker.</p><p>Hosea said that the arrest was a “complete overreaction” and the legal process left her feeling intimidated. &quot;As a foreign journalist it made me very nervous,” Hosea said. &quot;I am going to be much more cautious working in America. My status as a journalist didn&#x27;t mean anything; it was shocking.&quot;</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2019-11-14_at_11.32.0.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,"<p>While filming protesters at this pipeline construction site in Minnesota for her documentary, journalist Leana Hosea was arrested and her video camera was seized for two months.</p>",arrested and released,charges dropped,None,None,False,None,returned in full,False,law enforcement,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,"pipeline, protest",,disorderly conduct,,,,,

He said that there were three or four confrontations in which he was ordered to stop filming and that protesters would block the cameras with shields and would sometimes escort reporters away from the scene.</p><p>Armando Aparicio, Woodhouse’s partner on the documentary project, told Ellerbeck that one protester put a shield in his face and followed him everyone that he went. He said that protesters were screaming that they did not want to be in his video. Aparicio said that he put a cap on his lens and stepped back after being threatened.</p><p>Both Woodhouse and Aparicio said that the protesters seemed to have a conflicted relationship with the media. The protest took place in a public sphere and banners and signs seemed designed to be captured by the press, but at the same time protesters seemed to be afraid of having their identities captured on camera. </p><p>“There is a fear of doxing [having identities publicly revealed] both by the alt right and law enforcement,” said Aparicio.</p><p>“We were in a public park,” Woodhouse wrote on his blog. “It was a big news event, where everybody knew there would be media. Activists in the Black Bloc were concealed by sunglasses and ski masks to protect their identity for exactly this reason. They carried flags and banners, to make themselves a spectacle. Yet for their personal security, many of them decided that it was their right to command photographers not to take their pictures, to physically block them from doing so, and if they persisted, to smash their equipment and assault them.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2017-09-12_at_1.11.31.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A screengrab from a video shot by Nathan Hope shows a protester trying to block him from filming an assault.</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,private individual,yes,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,"Armando Aparicio, Leighton Woodhouse, Nathan Hope",,"anti-fascist protest, protest",,,,,,,

The <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/opinion/steve-scalise-congress-shot-alexandria-virginia.html?module=inline"">editorial</a> connected Palin’s rhetoric with the 2011 mass shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and at least 17 others. The Times quickly issued a correction and <a href=""https://twitter.com/nytopinion/status/875377356944396290"">issued an apology on Twitter</a>.</p><p>Twelve days after the editorial was published, Palin sued The Times in federal court. Palin said in the lawsuit that The Times’s response “did not approach the degree of the retraction and apology necessary and warranted by The Times’s false assertion that Mrs. Palin incited murder,” The Times <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/business/sarah-palin-sues-new-york-times.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer"">reported</a>.</p><p>The Times filed a motion in July 2017 seeking to dismiss the case. Southern New York District Court Judge Jed Rakoff issued an order on Aug. 10 for the author of the editorial to testify, stating that it was necessary in order for him to determine whether to grant The Times’s motion, the newspaper <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/business/media/sarah-palin-new-york-times-defamation-lawsuit.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FLibel%20and%20Slander&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=63&amp;pgtype=collection"">reported</a>.</p><p>David McCraw, deputy general counsel for The Times, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/business/media/sarah-palin-new-york-times-defamation-lawsuit.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FLibel%20and%20Slander&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=63&amp;pgtype=collection"">said</a> the witness would be James Bennet, the newspaper’s editorial page editor who had introduced the statements cited in the lawsuit during the editorial process.</p><p>At a hearing on Aug. 16, Bennet testified that his intention was not to blame Palin for the 2011 shooting. “I did not intend and was not thinking of it as a causal link to the crime,” <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/business/media/a-times-editor-testifies-in-defamation-suit-filed-by-sarah-palin.html"">Bennet said under oath</a>.</p><p>Rakoff dismissed the case on Aug. 29, saying that Palin’s complaint failed to show that the mistakes in the editorial were made maliciously. The “actual malice” standard requires public officials show that news organizations knowingly published false information or acted with “reckless disregard for the statement’s truth or falsity,” <a href=""http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/proving-fault-actual-malice-and-negligence"">according to the Digital Media Law Project</a>.</p><p>Rakoff said <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3983101-ruling-in-palin-times-suit.html"">in his judgment</a>, “What we have here is an editorial, written and rewritten rapidly in order to voice an opinion on an immediate event of importance, in which are included a few factual inaccuracies somewhat pertaining to Mrs. Palin that are very rapidly corrected.”</p><p>“Negligence this may be; but defamation of a public figure it plainly is not,” Rakoff wrote.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/RTX3HF1R.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,<p>Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin filed a defamation suit against The New York Times for an editorial it published in June 2017.</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['CARRIED_OUT'],None,None,None,None,None,None,The New York Times,The New York Times,,,,,,,,

They direct the Department of Justice to only subpoena journalists for information as a last resort and require the attorney general to personally approve any subpoena of a journalist or news organization.</p><p>The guidelines also instruct the department to provide news organizations of advance notice of subpoenas and records requests related to journalism, so that the news organizations have a chance to fight the subpoenas in court before they are carried out.</p><p>The &quot;advance notice&quot; policy is a relatively recent addition to the guidelines. It was partly a response to concern that the Justice Department had secretly obtained journalists&#x27; communications as part of its leak investigations.</p><p>In 2013, it was revealed that the Justice Department secretly obtained access to a Fox News reporter&#x27;s private email account, and to months of phone records belonging to the Associated Press newsroom, in an attempt to identify journalists&#x27; sources.</p><p>If the Department of Justice makes it easier to subpoena journalists, then more journalists are likely to be threatened with jail time. The U.S. does not have a federal shield law, which means that reporters subpoenaed to testify about confidential sources in front of a federal grand jury must either comply — which means violating the promises of confidentiality they have to their sources — or risk being held in contempt of court and jailed.</p></div></div>","'We respect the important role that the press plays, and we’ll give them respect, but it is not unlimited,' Sessions said.

During this first crossing, Moore recalled, the officer had asked her an “unusual” number of questions. She said that typically the officers will ask five or six questions, but this time the officer asked twice as many. Moore said that the CBP officers asked her why she was entering Canada, and after she said that she was a journalist about to write about an event, one of the officers “said something like, ‘We’re going to keep an eye on you,’ or something ominous like that.”</p><p>She didn’t give the comment a second thought — until that evening, when she tried to cross the border back into the United States around 11:30 p.m. Immediately after she pulled up to the U.S. border stop, she said, CBP officers told her to park her car and leave her phone on the dashboard, powered on and unlocked. The officers also asked her if she had a passcode on her phone, which she did not.</p><p>The officers directed Moore into an office to wait, and while she wasn’t questioned, the officer working at the desk would not tell her how long the search would take and that she’d simply need to wait. After about 15 minutes, she was allowed to return to her car, which had clearly been searched. Moore told CPJ that the officers left some of her belongings strewn on the ground and the doors and trunk partially open.</p><p>Moore also noticed that her phone had been moved, and she is believes it is possible, if not likely, that the CBP officers may have accessed some of her confidential information and sources, including information related to a piece she is currently working on that involves illegal border crossing.</p><p>Journalists have little legal protection when it comes to electronic device searches at the border. A 2018 CBP directive requires agents to consult legal counsel if an individual objects to a search on the grounds of attorney–client privilege, but does not provide the same protection for journalists protecting confidential sources or materials.

At the time, Samsundar was reporting for Alpha News, an online news organization that covers Minnesota politics. </p><p>“I cover the news,” she tells the protesters.</p><p>One of the protesters repeatedly tells her to leave. She continues filming — ""It's a free country,"" she says — and then a man in black baseball cap briefly appears on screen before the picture quickly shudders and momentarily cuts out.  </p><p>Samsundar described what happened in an article on Alpha News, published June 11, 2017.</p><p>“He then grabbed my work phone, which was mounted on a portable selfie-stick, shoved me out of the way and threw the phone several feet away, in front of a line of State Patrol Officers,"" she wrote. ""The screen was completely shattered, but still recording.”</p><p>Samsundar believes that protesters also stole her personal phone, in addition to grabbing and throwing her work phone. </p><p>“I had my second phone in my backpack where I kept all of my equipment,"" she said. ""After I moved away from the group to be a bit safer, I went to look for my personal cell phone to see if I could use it to call my boss. ... That's when I knew it was gone.”<br/></p><p>After the protest, Samsundar said, some of the anti-fascist protesters followed her to her car after the protest.<br/></p><p>“I got into my car and that’s when they surrounded me and my car, started pounding on the windows,"" she said, adding the protesters threatened to break her windows if she didn't leave.</p><p>Mitch Berg, a local conservative radio show host, had planned to interview Samsundar after the rally. He said that Samsundar called him and told him that she had been surrounded by protesters angry with her reporting.</p><p>“I sent her a Facebook message asking if she could come on the air with me when she got clear of whatever was going on,"" Berg told the Freedom of the Press Foundation. ""She said she’d try and then she called me when she was going towards her car, and she mentioned she was being followed to her car. I could hear in the background, some yelling and some commotion. ... She mentioned, as I recall, her car was surrounded and people were a little too close for comfort, a little too animated for civil society, and she hung up and called me back about ten or fifteen minutes later.”</p><p>After the protest, Samsundar filed a police report with the St. Paul police department.</p><p>A spokesman for the St. Paul Police Department confirmed the contents of Samsundar’s police report, and told the Freedom of the Press Foundation the case is currently listed as inactive. </p><p>“Based on the reports, it looks like the journalist's personal cell phone was stolen and her work phone (and a selfie stick) were grabbed by a suspect and thrown about 25 to 30 feet, causing its face to crack. A group also followed her to her car, pounded on the vehicle and threatened her as she drove away.</p><p>An investigator worked to identify the suspect but was unfortunately able to do so.”</p><p>When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the Minnesota State Patrol said simply, “The items reported stolen occurred on a city street, which is St. Paul Police's jurisdiction.”</p><p>After learning about what happened to Samsundar on June 10, Alpha News hired private security for her.</p><p>Samsundar said that a bodyguard accompanied her the next time she reported on a protest, but she was still harassed.</p><p>""I was being threatened and people came up to me and said I need to behave myself or else,"" she said. ""The bodyguard with me was like, 'I don’t want you to get hurt. I want you to be safe, so if you please could just do as little as possible in this situation to make it work that’d be great.' I was a little bummed because as a journalist I want to talk to these people, find out why they’re here, and I’m being told I can’t.”</p><p>Samsundar said that she continued filming the protest march for ten to fifteen minutes, until the harassment escalated and her security guard pulled her back and advised her to leave the protest.</p><p>After that experience, Samsundar left journalism. She is now a communications specialist for the Minnesota GOP.</p><p>“These guys targeted me from day one once they knew who I was,"" she said. ""It got to the point where my bosses didn't want me going out to cover stories because they feared for my safety. It was one reason I changed jobs. If I couldn't go out and do my job, there was no point.”</p><p>Organizers of the June 10 counter-protest did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p></p><p></p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/preya.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,private individual,yes,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,Preya Samsundar,,"anti-fascist protest, protest",,,,,,,

When CBP officers directed her to secondary inspection, they took her laptop and and ordered her to turn over her smartphone.</p><p>Merchant objected, in part because her phone contained pictures of her without her headscarf that she did not want the male officers to see, but also because it contained information and communications related to her blog. According to the complaint, a CBP officer told her that her phone would be seized indefinitely if she did not comply.</p><p>“In tears, Ms. Merchant unlocked her phone. She also provided the password to unlock her laptop,” the complaint added.</p><p>During the hour and a half that Merchant’s electronic devices were out of her sight, CBP officers thoroughly searcher her bags, read her graduate school notebooks and questioned her about her religious affiliation and her blog. Officers specifically asked about an article she had written for Zainab Rights describing her experience at the border in 2016 which was critical of CBP’s actions.</p><p>Merchant spent approximately two hours in the inspection area before she was permitted to leave for the boarding area.

The Transportation Security Administration officer checking Merchant’s boarding pass told her she would need to pass through security again, a process which took an hour and caused her to miss her flight.</p><p>In a 2018 opinion article in The Washington Post, Merchant <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/i-may-have-to-quit-harvard--because-the-tsa-wont-stop-searching-me/2018/08/14/0dbdbb72-9a55-11e8-b55e-5002300ef004_story.html"">outlined how she was detained</a> for secondary screenings <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/journalist-graduate-student-stopped-again-secondary-screening/"">multiple times</a> in the previous two year period, including one in 2016 that involved her husband and then-6-month-old baby for six hours. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker includes incidents only from 2017 forward.</p><p>In the Post, Merchant said that as the stops continued she filed a complaint through DHS’s Travel Redress Inquiry Program, wrote to members of Congress and applied for TSA Precheck and CBP Global Entry, programs designed to expedite domestic and international travel. She said her efforts were to no avail.</p><p>“Am I being stopped because I am Muslim, or because my family once traveled to Iran to visit a holy shrine?

LaPorta said that he did not notify Camp Lejeune&#x27;s public affairs office before his visit, in part because his source specifically told him that she did not trust the public affairs office.</p><p>After interviewing the woman, LaPorta said, he went to Camp Lejeune&#x27;s brig to visit the officer accused of sexual assault.

(LaPorta said that he had already interviewed the officer twice before he was taken into custody and so had no reason to interview him again during the February visit.)</p><p>Five days later, Camp Lejeune deputy commander Col. Scalise sent a letter to LaPorta informing him that he had violated regulations by interviewing the woman and visiting the officer in the brig.

I spoke with her when I first arrived!”</p><p>In the video, Johnny Burt says that she does not permission to film the rally: “Listen, I’m the owner and I say no.”<br/>Burt’s Farm did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The video ends shortly after Wooten forcibly pushes away Tisdale’s camera, at which point Tisdale can be heard screaming off-screen, “Ow, that hurts! You’re hurting me! You are really hurting me!”</p><p>Tisdale told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that after the video was shut off, two uniformed Dawson County Sheriff’s Office deputies arrived to take her into custody. At this point, she said, Wooten finally revealed his name and formally placed her under arrest, but did not give a reason for the arrest or read Tisdale her Miranda rights.</p><p>Tisdale was eventually charged with felony obstruction, felony trespassing, and misdemeanor obstruction of an officer. At trial, prosecutors accused her of elbowing and kicking Wooten.</p><p>The Dawson County Sheriff’s Office seized Tisdale’s camera when she was arrested and held it in custody for six days before returning it to her.</p><p>Tisdale believes that the police may have edited her video footage of the altercation.</p><p>She said that she checked the video footage on her camera once it was returned to her and noticed that her video footage had been split into two separate videos, and the portion of the video in which she could be heard screaming had been inexplicably deleted.</p><p>An audio recording of the incident, captured by Brian Pritchard of FetchYourNews, clearly shows that Tisdale screamed for help during the altercation.</p><p>Dawson County Sheriff Billy Carlisle told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the department had not edited Tisdale’s video footage.</p><p>Tisdale said that she had bruises on her arms, feet, and pelvic region for days after the altercation and had trouble eating and sleeping.</p><p>In August 2016, Tisdale filed a sexual assault complaint against Captain Tony Wooten, alleging that he pushed his crotch into her buttocks while he bent her over a countertop. That case was stayed pending the outcome of the criminal charges against Tisdale.</p><p>On Aug. 8, 2016, Tony Wooten resigned from the Dawson County Sheriff’s Office.</p><p>On Dec. 4, 2017, a Dawsonville jury convicted Tisdale on a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of an officer, but acquitted her of felony charges of obstruction and trespassing.</p><p>“This is a partial victory, but not a complete victory, and I maintain my innocence of all charges,” Tisdale told the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “Video recording is not a crime.”</p><p>On Dec. 18, 2017, Tisdale was sentenced to 12 months probation, 40 hours of community service, and a $1000 fine.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2018-01-11_at_7.31.03.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A screengrab from Nydia Tisdale&#x27;s video shows Dawsonville County Sheriff&#x27;s Office deputy Tony Wooten pushing her into a countertop before taking her into custody.</p>,arrested and released,convicted,None,None,True,None,returned in part,False,law enforcement,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,law enforcement,yes,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,Nydia Tisdale,,,obstructing a public officer,"felony, obstructing a public officer, trespassing",,,,,
